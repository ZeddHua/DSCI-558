Inspired by the 1985 discovery of the Titanic in the North Atlantic the contemporary storyline involves American treasure-seeker Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) retrieving artifacts from the submerged ship. Lovett looks for diamonds but finds a drawing of a young woman nude except for a necklace. When 102-year-old Rose (Gloria Stuart) reveals she's the person in the portrait she is summoned to the wreckage site to tell her story of the 56-carat diamond necklace and her experiences of 84 years earlier. The scene then shifts to 1912 Southampton where passengers boarding the Titanic include penniless Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) returning to Philadelphia with her wealthy fiance Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). After the April 10th launch Rose develops a passionate interest in Jack and Cal's reaction is vengeful. At midpoint in the film the Titanic slides against the iceberg and water rushes into the front compartments. Even engulfed Cal continues to pursue Jack and Rose as the massive liner begins its descent. Cameron launched the project after seeing Robert Ballard's 1987 National Geographic documentary on the wreckage. Blueprints of the real Titanic were followed during construction at Fox's custom-built Rosarito Mexico studio where a hydraulics system moved an immense model in a 17-million-gallon water tank. During three weeks aboard the Russian ship Academik Keldysh underwater sequences were filmed with a 35mm camera in a titanium case mounted on the Russian submersible Mir 1. When the submersible neared the wreck a video camera inside a remote-operated vehicle was sent into the Titanic's 400-foot bow bringing back footage of staterooms furniture and chandeliers. On November 1 1997 the film had its world premiere at the 10th Tokyo International Film Festival. ~ Bhob Stewart Rovi

After an emergency sends Gillian away to Denver Bob steps up and offers to watch the kids while she's gone. Ill-equipped to handle a situation that's clearly over his head Bob utilizes his spy skills and gadgets -- video watch GPS tracking x-ray glasses -- to gain control over the situation in hopes of winning over the kid's affection but when an old enemy escapes from prison and threatens his potential family Bob must return to his 007 world of international espionage to protect them.Admittedly there's a certain level of cheese in this film especially when it comes to the Boris-and-Natasha-style villains Poldark (Magns Scheving) and Creel (Katherine Boecher) whose silly Russian stereotyped performances and running joke about American fashion unabashedly border on cringe-worthy territory. Not to mention the thinly plotted storyline involving brainiac Ian who accidentally downloads a top-secret formula for oil-eating ooze created by the bad guys which propels the main action of the film. Adding to the pile are the supporting cast members: George Lopez as the traitorous CIA agent Glaze and Billy Ray Cyrus as CIA agent and Bob's BFF Colton James who lends folksy witticisms like ""As gone as rum cake at an AA meeting.""Even so Chan's charm wins out in the end and The Spy Next Door's most effective sequences involve Bob's attempts to bond with the kids -- from taking little Nora shopping for a Halloween costume to helping Ian with school bullies and girls. These comedic moments more or less overshadow an otherwise simplistic narrative and the audience can't help but smile to themselves every time Chan appears onscreen. Die-hard fans might miss the era of classic kick-ass Hong Kong action films but Spy manages to fill that void as an entertaining alternative that kids and parents alike will enjoy. ~ Alaina O'Connor Rovi"

We might fight over what image it is. We might think it's a painting of Marilyn Monroe we might think it's a painting of a car crash or the atom bomb or a Campbell's soup can. But I think if we had to choose a painting it would be a painting by Andy Warhol.""--Neil Printz art historianNo artist of the second half of the twentieth century was more famous--or in the end more famously misunderstood--than Andy Warhol: at once the most accessible and enigmatic straightforward and elusive naive and savagely ironic artist of his time. Radically revising the meaning of art and our sense of what painting could be he took the idea of art in the age of mechanical reproduction to its logical extreme--permanently breaching the wall dividing art and commerce. Grasping as no one before or since the function of fame in a mass society he forced us to confront and re-envision the world we live in. Along the way he transformed himself into the unlikely poet laureate of the American century--the high priest and Pied Piper of one of the most radical experiments in the history of American culture--and the greatest and most resoundingly influential artist of his age. ANDY WARHOL--a four-hour documentary film for broadcast on PBS as part of the American Masters 20th Anniversary season premieres September 20th and 21st 2006. This landmark television event is a riveting and often deeply moving film portrait of the most important artist of the second half of the twentieth century set within the turbulent and constantly changing context of his life and times. Combining penetrating on-camera interviews and never-before-seen still and archival motion picture footage with the testimony of Warhol's bewilderingly vast body of work itself the film will be the first to exploit in depth the immense Warhol archives at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. It will also be the first to explore the complete spectrum of his astonishing artistic output stretching across five decades from the late 1940's to his untimely death in the 1980's--and the first to put Warhol himself--his background and history his family life and formative experiences in Pittsburgh his crucial experiences as a commercial artist in New York and his trajectory across three of the most transforming decades of the century--back into the presentation of his life.

On one side Detective Aubray faces the scrutiny of a bright young detective (Scott Speedman) who has his own unique ideas about the killings and on the other a disturbed young woman (Clea Duvall) who proves a dangerous link to Detective Aubray's mystery-shrouded past. Only by confronting the possibility that he fears most will Detective Aubray finally be able to overcome his own stifling sense of guilt and finally uncover the truth about the most gruesome crimes ever committed in New York City. ~ Jason Buchanan Rovi"

This prison as it were became a kind of ""diving bell"" for Bauby -- one with no means of escape.

By moving his eyes and blinking he not only began to interact again with the world around him but -- astonishingly -- authored the said memoir via a code used to signify specific letters of the alphabet.

The culture clash between Anna and the King is but one aspect of their multilayered relationship. Through Anna the King learns the refineries and responsibilities of ""modern"" western civilization; Anna meanwhile comes to realize how important it is for an Oriental ruler to maintain his pride and to uphold the customs of his people. After a successful evening entertaining foreign dignitaries Anna and the King celebrate with an energetic dance but this is cut short by a bitter quarrel over the cruel punishment of the King's new Burmese wife Tuptim (Rita Moreno) who has dared to fall in love with someone else. Despite the many rifts between them Anna and the monarch come to respect and (to a degree) love one another. When the King dies Anna agrees to stay on to offer help and advice to the new ruler of Siam young Prince Chulalongkhorn (Patrick Adiarte). In general The King and I tends to be somewhat stagey with the notable exception of the matchless ""Small House of Uncle Thomas"" ballet which utilizes the Cinemascope 55 format to best advantage (the process also does a nice job of ""handling"" Deborah Kerr's voluminous hoopskirts). Most of the Broadway version's best songs (""Getting to Know You"" ""Whistle a Happy Tune"" ""A Puzzlement"" ""Shall We Dance"" etc.) are retained. None of the omissions are particularly regrettable save for Anna's solo ""Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?"" This feisty attack on the King's chauvinism was specially written to suit the talents of Gertrude Lawrence who played Anna in the original production; the song was cut from the film because it made Deborah Kerr seem ""too bitchy"" (Kerr's singing incidentally is dubbed for the most part by the ubiquitous Marni Nixon). When all is said and done the principal attraction of The King and I is Yul Brynner in the role that made him a star and with which he will forever be identified. ~ Hal Erickson Rovi"

(As Willis figures it the bankers -- all covered by insurance -- are merely thieves themselves anyway.) A sweetly contemplative film The Newton Boys is almost an anti-crime caper -- no one gets killed and the violence which does occasionally erupt is handled with a light comic touch. By no means a master storyteller Linklater has instead crafted a movie tailored to his own strengths among them his skillful direction of actors his flair for period detail and his unerring sense of rhythm; like all of his work The Newton Boys is also informed by its maker's deep and abiding love for the film medium itself complete with any number of striking visual and emotional references to classics ranging from Greed to Jules et Jim.
