{"title": "Vocal", "url": "https://www.allmusic.com/genre/vocal-ma0000011877", "discription": "                Vocal music is a term describing classic mainstream American pop performed either by individual singers or vocal groups. Before rock & roll, pop vocalists didn't write their own material, they interpreted songs written by such professional songwriters as Irving Berlin, George Gershwin and Cole Porter. Often, they would sing these songs supported by an orchestra or a swinging big band. During the '30s and '40s, vocalists were the centerpiece of these big bands and such singers as Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra became huge stars, as did such groups as the Andrews Sisters. These vocal groups paved the way for the vocal groups of the '40s and '50s, who sang similar songs in similar styles, but tended toward lighter material. For the remainder of the century, vocalists continued to return to the traditional pop and showtunes for inspiration, and they often built upon the vocal innovations of such singers as Crosby, Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald and Mel Torme.

Since then, rap spread from its New York epicenter throughout the remainder of the U.S. (with each region taking on its own specific flavor) and then to countless countries. Rap's core components are beats and rhymes, but that simplicity belies the wide range of sounds that have sprung from them. Instrumentalists, a sampled breakbeat, or a drum machine can form the backbone of a track, while an arrangement can be spaciously spare or chaotically dense, and a chorus can range from atonal shouting to a sweet melody. Detractors were still calling rap a fad in 1985, when LL Cool J released his first single. They were doing the same thing when, roughly 20 years later, the same MC released his tenth album, and they'll probably continue to do so as long as the genre exists. Should rap ever die, which isn't likely, it would be far too late to prevent its effect on most other music forms, from R&B to rock to jazz.

Reggae's direct forefather is ska, an uptempo, rhythmic variation based on the New Orleans R&B Jamaican musicians heard broadcast from the US on their transistor radios. Relying on skittering guitar and syncopated rhythms, ska was their interpretation of R&B and it was quite popular in the early '60s. However, during one very hot summer, it was too hot to either play or dance to ska, so the beat was slowed down and reggae was born. Since then, reggae has proven to be as versatile as the blues, as it lends itself to a number of interpretations, from the melodic rock steady of Alton Ellis and the rock and folk-influenced songwriting of Bob Marley to the trippy, near-psychedelic soundscapes of dub artists like Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. It has crossed into the mainstream through the bright, bouncy \"reggae sunsplash\" festivals and pop-oriented bands like UB40, but more adventurous reggae artists, such as Marley and Perry, have influenced countless reggae, folk, rock and dance artists. Their contributions resonate throughout popular music.            "}

R&B kept the tempo and the drive of jump blues, but its instrumentation was sparer and the emphasis was on the song, not improvisation. It was blues chord changes played with an insistent backbeat. During the '50s, R&B was dominated by vocalists like Ray Charles and Ruth Brown, as well as vocal groups like the Drifters and the Coasters. Eventually, R&B metamorphosed into soul, which was funkier and looser than the pile-driving rhythms of R&B. Soul came to describe a number of R&B-based music styles. From the bouncy, catchy acts at Motown to the horn-driven, gritty soul of Stax/Volt, there was an immense amount of diversity within soul. During the first part of the '60s, soul music remained close to its R&B roots. However, musicians pushed the music in different directions; usually, different regions of America produced different kinds of soul. In urban centers like New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, the music concentrated on vocal interplay and smooth productions. In Detroit, Motown concentrated on creating a pop-oriented sound that was informed equally by gospel, R&B, and rock & roll. In the South, the music became harder and tougher, relying on syncopated rhythms, raw vocals, and blaring horns. All of these styles formed soul, which ruled the black music charts throughout the '60s and also frequently crossed over into the pop charts. During the '60s and '70s, soul began to splinter apart -- artists like James Brown and Sly Stone developed funk; Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff initiated Philly soul with the O'Jays and Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes; and later in the decade, danceable R&B became a mass phenomenon with the brief disco fad. During the '80s and '90s, the polished, less earthy sound of urban and quiet storm ruled the airwaves, but even then, R&B began adding stylistic components of hip-hop until -- by the end of the millennium -- there were hundreds of artists who featured both rapping and singing on their records.

From the outset, when the early rockers merged country and blues, rock has been defined by its energy, rebellion and catchy hooks, but as the genre aged, it began to shed those very characteristics, placing equal emphasis on craftmanship and pushing the boundaries of the music. As a result, everything from Chuck Berry's pounding, three-chord rockers and the sweet harmonies of the Beatles to the jarring, atonal white noise of Sonic Youth has been categorized as \"rock.\" That's accurate -- rock & roll had a specific sound and image for only a handful of years.

{"title": "Latin", "url": "https://www.allmusic.com/genre/latin-ma0000002692", "discription": "                Latin music is a catch-all term for a number of diverse styles from different regions and countries in Latin America. Often, the term refers to Latin pop -- either dance-based or pop oriented-music sung in Spanish or Tejano. Tejano has a number of different styles, from romantic ballads to the narrative nortenos, and they're usually performed by large groups with acoustic instruments and horns. In the '80s and '90s, Tejano has also adopted smooth production techniques from American pop-rock and soft rock. Latin America is also known for such dance music as salsas and sambas, which have layers of percussion, blaring horns and an infectious sense of style. A related style to salsa is the bossa nova, a cool, laid-back style that crossed dance music with jazz. With the exception of tejano and mariachi, which is folk and pop based, most Latin music is defined by its strong rhythms.

Some of these albums are artistically satisfying as well as therapeutic.

Along with the blues, its forefather, it is one of the first truly indigenous musics to develop in America, yet its unpredictable, risky ventures into improvisation gave it critical cache with scholars that the blues lacked. At the outset, jazz was dance music, performed by swinging big bands. Soon, the dance elements faded into the background and improvisation became the key element of the music. As the genre evolved, the music split into a number of different styles, from the speedy, hard-hitting rhythms of be-bop and the laid-back, mellow harmonies of cool jazz to the jittery, atonal forays of free jazz and the earthy grooves of soul jazz. What tied it all together was a foundation in the blues, a reliance on group interplay and unpredictable improvisation.

Its beginnings came in the post-disco environment of Chicago/New York and Detroit, the cities who spawned house and techno (respectively) during the 1980s. Later that decade, club-goers in Britain latched onto the fusion of mechanical and sensual, and returned the favor to hungry Americans with new styles like jungle/drum'n'bass and trip-hop. Though most all early electronica was danceable, by the beginning of the '90s, producers were also making music for the headphones and chill-out areas as well, resulting in dozens of stylistic fusions like ambient-house, experimental techno, tech-house, electro-techno, etc. Typical for the many styles gathered under the umbrella was a focus on danceable grooves, very loose song structure (if any), and, in many producers, a relentless desire to find a new sound no matter how tepid the results.

{"title": "Folk", "url": "https://www.allmusic.com/genre/folk-ma0000002592", "discription": "                Each country has their own folk music, but the genre usually refers to American and British music that has been passed through the generations by oral tradition. It's simple, acoustic-based music that spins everyday events and common people into mythic status. Many traditional folksongs have no known author, they have simply evolved over the years. Most of the earliest recorded folk music was of this nature, but with Woody Guthrie, topical folk began making its way to record. Still, many artists, including the Weavers and Pete Seeger, chose to mix traditional songs with newer material, either written by the artists themselves or other contemporary musicians. Initially, Bob Dylan functioned in that style, but by his second album, =The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,= he began relying entirely on original material, thereby ushering the modern era of folk, where most performers sang their own (usually personally and introspective) material, and only occasionally throwing in covers.

At its core, the blues has remained the same since its inception. Most blues feature simple, usually three-chord, progressions and have simple structures that are open to endless improvisations, both lyrical and musical. The blues grew out of African spirituals and worksongs. In the late 1800s, southern African-Americans passed the songs down orally, and they collided with American folk and country from the Appalachians. New hybrids appeared by each region, but all of the recorded blues from the early 1900s are distinguished by simple, rural acoustic guitars and pianos. After World War II, the blues began to fragment, with some musicians holding on to acoustic traditions and others taking it to jazzier territory. However, most bluesmen followed Muddy Waters' lead and played the blues on electric instruments. From that point on, the blues continued to develop in new directions -- particularly on electric instruments -- or it has been preserved as an acoustic tradition.

Its key emphasis is the faithful interpretation of composers' written scores. Classical music's roots lie in the chant melodies of Medieval religious rites. Its contemporary incarnation encompasses everything from opera and the symphony orchestra to chamber ensembles, solo works, choral music, songs, film music, and the avant-garde. Works from the intervening centuries make up the bulk of the recorded repertory, and they mirror the artistic and architectural trends of the Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern eras in their sound worlds and conception. The dichotomy between classical and popular music is a fairly recent cultural development. In fact, much of what is considered classical music today grew out of, was influenced by, or was popular music of its time.            "}

Their dances, called the fofa and the lundum -- a lewd song and dance exchange -- heavily influenced the development of the fado, as did the rich Portuguese history of poetry and literature, with the folk culture of quatrains (rhyming couplets) and the modhina (ballad tradition) recognized as the cathartic music's lyrical origins. While the first fado recordings date back to 1910, the music truly flowered during the 1920s and '30s, when a series of landmark records documenting the fado de Coimbra style -- a tightly rehearsed, highly stylized, and far less cathartic form --  was released. Despite their differences, both strains of the fado are defined by their feeling of \"saudade,\" a Portuguese term best translating into English as a genuine and intense yearning. Amalia Rodrigues is undoubtedly the most important figure in fado.            "}

His recorded works are among the most celebrated guitar pieces to date. The fascinating thing about flamenco recordings is that each piece can sound different each time a master performs it. There are countless recognizable phrases and themes, but the music is rarely (if ever) played the same way twice, and many flamenco musicians do not write or read music.

The fandango is thought to be of South American origin and is written in triple time with a continuous increase in speed. The dance itself has a number of sudden stops and is most often accompanied by guitar and castanets. The malague\u00f1a is a variety of the fandango from malala and murcia, which came to Mexico by way of Spanish settlers.  It is also a gypsy song involving a great deal of improvisation, cadenzas, and guitar accompaniment. The songs contend with amorous subjects and can be played as instrumental pieces as well. The third dance form characterizing the Andalusian classical style is the polo; it is both a folk song and a dance. Of the three, polo tends to be the most moderate; it's in 3/8 time with an emphasis on syncopation and vocal coloraturas, particularly performed over the syllables \"aye\" and \"ole.\"             "}

The funky bass rhythm, horn section, and vocalists create a unified sound, urging the dancers to move in rhythmic motion. Compared with Zairian soukous, makossa's sound is leaner, using fewer instruments and more musical space. Western instruments are dominant in makossa -- horns, guitar, bass guitar, drums, and piano. The \"kossa\" dances of young Douala children, with its hand-clapping accompaniment, are the origins of the makossa style. These were combined with Latin influences, popular music from other countries in Africa (especially Nigerian highlife), and Congolese rhumba to create this vibrant sound. Makossa has developed over the years in Cameroon. A precursor to makossa, ambasse bey, was a guitar music played in the neighborhoods of Douala in the 1950s. Although people experimented with creating different variations of music in both urban and rural areas of Africa, it was not until the early 1960s that makossa began to be recorded by Eboa Lotin, a guitar and harmonica player who composed and sang songs. Misse Ngoh, a singer and guitarist known for his fingerpicking style, transformed makossa even further. Manu Dibango's album Soul Makossa, released in the early 1970s, drew international attention to Cameroon and its unique musical sound. Dibango's resonant voice and lyrical saxophone provide a distinct flavor to this urban music. By the 1980s, new-look makossa emerged. Major artists, such as Dibango, continue to experiment with and adapt the makossa sound according to their own artistic creativity.             "}

Twenty-one strings are ttached to the long rosewood neck. The kora player usually sits or stands, holding the kora in a upright position with the bottom of the instrument resting lightly against his body and the strings facing him directly. He plays with both hands, plucking the strings like one would a harp, and producing different patterns on each hand which combine to create a melodious and rhythmic sound. Played by the jeli -- the hereditary musicians of the Mande -- this instrument is often accompanied by a female jeli singer. Sometimes the kora player sings praises to the gods, or heroic songs like the famous Sunjata epic. Most likely because of its accessible sound to Western audiences, the kora has become a popular African instrument. Recordings of acoustic kora playing are as equally appealing to an international audience, as is the more recent electrified kora. In Gambia, a small country along the Gambia river in Senegal, the kora is particularly important, representing Gambia's national identity and helping to attract tourists to the region. Artists Dembo Konte, Malamini Jobarteh, and Kausu Kouyate are just a few of the kora players from Gambia who perform at home and abroad. Foday Musa Suso has collaborated with American musician Herbie Hancock to create a kora-based musical fusion. In Mali, Sidiki Diabate and his son Toumani Diabate perform traditional kora. Toumani Diabate has toured Europe, playing kora with other musical forms, such as a Spanish flamenco-rock group. This collaborative effort resulted in the group Songhai. The flamenco guitar, kora, and songs in both Bambara and Spanish create a truly unique sound. Other artists, such as Mory Kante from Guinea, play kora or kora melodies on electric guitar and other instruments.             "}

In its fully developed form, juju is a dance music played by large ensembles centered around guitar and percussion: several guitarists play interlocking, complex melodies over a thundering wall of rhythm, led by traditional Yoruba talking drums (whose heads can be tightened or loosened while they're being played, in order to change the drum's pitch and more closely mimic human speech patterns). Lyrics are important as well, drawing upon the large storehouse of Yoruba oral tradition -- poetry, proverbs, praise songs -- and the inherently musical qualities of the language, in which the meaning of some words changes with different pitches. Early juju music, which emerged as far back as the 1920s, was essentially an intersection between Yoruba drumming and the socially oriented, string-based palm-wine style, which developed in the drinking houses at the time and influenced highlife music as well. Pioneers like Tunde King and Ojoge Daniel made the first juju recordings during the early '30, but while they achieved a measure of popularity, juju didn't really become a sensation until after World War II, with the advent of electric amplification. Tunde Nightingale was the first real juju star, and during the mid-'50s, he was eclipsed by the legendary I.K. Dairo, who greatly expanded the ensemble (from four musicians to around ten) and became the first juju artist to feature talking drums, electric guitars, and accordion -- essentially shaping the sound of the music into its most widely known form. Chief Commander Ebenezer Obey and King Sunny Ade both began performing around the mid-'60s, and the rivalry that developed between the two during the '70s became a period of intense creative fertility for juju music. Releasing several albums per year, each constantly attempted to outdo the other by expanding their bands, adding new instruments (including keyboards and Hawaiian steel guitars), and increasing the lengths of their songs (each new innovation was dubbed a different \"system,\" spawning hundreds of imitators around Yoruba territory). At the dawn of the '80s, both Obey and Ade brought their music to the international stage, the former with his 1980 album Current Affairs, and the latter by signing to Island for 1982's Juju Music. In contrast to the more conservative Obey, Island hyped Ade as the inheritor of Bob Marley's populist mantle, but when Ade's follow-ups Synchro System and Aura failed to perform up to commercial expectations, he was dropped from the label. Although Ade and Obey continued to command sizable audiences, the mid-'80s brought a general decline in juju's fortunes. Young Nigerians had begun listening to juju-influenced pop music, and the more percussion-oriented fuji style had begun to capture a share of the market as well. Both Obey and Ade continued to record into the '90s, although on a smaller scale and with less regularity (partly due to an increasingly strict governmental regime).            "}

In origins the bikutsi rhythms were war- and blood-affirming. The music would call the people together by resounding through the forest. Such calls were made for requisite vengeance against other groups. These heavily energetic rhythms were meant to enjoin one's blood to boil -- in the figurative sense -- for the cause of war. Rhythmic dances of the bikutsi were preserved by the women as a response to Christian missionaries who attempted to \"save\" the people from their own \"sinful\" expressions. Storytelling occurred, followed by dances in which the shaking of the shoulders, back, and buttocks were succeeded by a series of clapping. The dances are still performed and the fighting concepts have been removed. Sexual underpinnings and fantasies (as told in the stories of the women) clearly remain in the bikutsi rhythms.

It is unlike Western pianos, however, as indicated by the \"scales\" played on the instrument. The nearest word for a scale does not refer to the intervals in an octave: \"mutalvha\" may refer to the set of 24 heptatonic stopped pipes used for tshikona, the 12 pentatonic stopped pipes used for givha or visa, or a row of keys on the xylophone or \"mbira\" (the lamellaphone is often referred to as a hand piano). The mbira is used in the accompaniment of such dance forms as jit and chimurenga. Both are popular and important dance forms with roots in the traditional mbira music of Zimbabwe's Shona people. In 1986, the Bhundu Boys exposed England and Scotland to jit, touring and performing for receptive audiences. Most jit music is lighter than chimurenga, which relies more on the traditional mbira instrument's rhythm and sound. Chimurenga has roots in the mbira music and Bira religion of the Shona people.   During the colonial period and under later white rule, traditional musics were repressed. The mbira has a strong role in the traditional Bira religion. When played at Bira ceremonies, the mbira is believed to be a way to communicate with the ancestors. Because of the mbira's connection with traditional religion, missionaries tried to prevent its use. As a result, mbira music represents the struggle and persistence of Shona culture and is viewed by many as Zimbabwe's national music. Ephat Mujuru has made the mbira music familiar to international audiences by giving concerts and presentations of mbira music around the world.             "}

At first, mbaqanga was an instrumental music, an urban outgrowth of the pennywhistle jive music (or kwela) that groups of black street musicians had imported from rural areas. When record companies began to record pennywhistle jive in the early '50s, more elaborate arrangements and compositions began to replace the simpler format of a lead melodic flute soloing over harmonies provided by two or three other flutes. Mbaqanga was born when the saxophone replaced the pennywhistle as lead instrument on Spokes Mashiyane's 1958 single \"Big Joe Special.\" The music wasn't nearly as complex as jazz, since most mbaqanga musicians learned to play through feel, not by reading music; it was built mostly around simple melodies and rhythms that could be easily repeated. As mbaqanga developed, electric bass was added to the rhythm section, and the percussion accompaniment became correspondingly more powerful and danceable in order to keep pace. Electric guitars completed the transition to fully non-acoustic instrumentation in the early '60s, and soon afterwards, vocals began to appear on mbaqanga records, based on an Africanized version of American doo wop harmony that relied on five parts instead of the customary four. As practiced by pioneers Mahlathini & the Mahotella Queens, vocal mbaqanga (dubbed \"mqashiyo\") relied on female vocalists to handle the intricate harmonies, and a growling, deep-voiced \"groaner,\" as the male vocalist came to be known, who provided a sharply contrasting sound. This formula persevered into the '70s, and although Mahlathini & the Mahotella Queens retained their popularity, most new mbaqanga bands featured only male vocalists. However, imported American soul and disco records were capturing the younger audience by this time, and had it not been for the international discovery of mbaqanga in 1986 thanks to records like The Indestructible Beat of Soweto and Paul Simon's Graceland (which actually owed much more to Zulu a cappella singing than mbaqanga), most of the music's audience would have disappeared.

It is a keyed instrument, sometimes referred to as a thumb piano, that contains between 20 and 50 tuned metal strips, prongs, or keys attached to a resonating chamber. They are commonly tuned to a heptatonic scale, although one of the four types of mbira is tuned to a hexatonic scale. Religiously, these instruments are very important in ceremonies dealing with spiritual possession and political involvement & protest. Ceremonial music often begins at sundown on Saturday and continues through to the early morning hours of Sunday. Mbira thumb-piano music became adapted to the electric guitar during the 1970s and 1980s. The guitar music, combined with the beseeching melodies and rough rhythms of the shona, became associated with the beer-filled nights of anti-colonial protests. Chimurenga, which means struggle, is the music and dance style developed by Thomas Mapfumo from the mbira rhythms and indigenous musical roots of Zimbabwe.

Ironically enough, the music of the gypsy bands is not indigenous to their culture; true gypsy folk music uses virtually no instrumentation -- instead, the improvised songs are accompanied by rhythmic grunts.

Much of the national music derives from the annual rituals of peasant life, with the sowing and harvest seasons each generating their own traditional songs. Also hugely important to Hungarian life are rites of passage, including marriage and induction into the military; both events are defined by music -- each crucial moment of a wedding has its own traditional accompaniment. By and large, the Bulgarian bands that perform at weddings and other ceremonies consist of gaida (bagpipes), kaval (an end-blown flute), gadulka (a bowed string instrument), and tambura (a strummed string instrument of the lute family); a tapan (a large drum) will sometimes also be added.

{"title": "Adult Contemporary", "url": "https://www.allmusic.com/style/adult-contemporary-ma0000004445", "discription": "                Adult contemporary is essentially a continuation of the soft rock style that became popular in the '70s, with a few adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop-music production techniques. Adult contemporary has the same lush, soothing, highly polished qualities as soft rock, and it works the same \"middle of the road\" territory -- in other words, it largely lacks the grit of even the slicker varieties of rock or soul music, but it's too indebted to those original sources to qualify as traditional pop or easy listening. The main dividing line between soft rock and adult contemporary is that the latter commonly features synthesizers (and other electronics, such as drum machines) as an important component of the music's smooth studio sheen. Both as a style and a popular radio format, adult contemporary was heavy on romantic ballads, but there was also room for catchy pop/rock (often updating styles -- early rock & roll, smooth soul, Beatlesque pop -- that adult contemporary's main audience had grown up with) and thoughtful singer/songwriter sensibilities. Some artists stayed in adult contemporary territory with pretty much everything they did, but the format also provided a home for ballads by dance-pop and urban soul singers (and, sometimes, those styles' most popular artists could land some AC airplay with their more typical work). Adult contemporary was usually melodic enough to hold listeners' attention, but agreeable and inoffensive enough to work equally well as background music; most critics reviled it as sonic wallpaper or overly safe, sentimental glop, but that didn't prevent it from becoming one of the most popular radio formats of the '80s. Adult contemporary's visibility dwindled just a bit in the '90s, mainly because the rigidly compartmentalized state of radio and the decline of Top 40 programming during the decade meant that AC artists couldn't necessarily rely on as much hit-making exposure outside of their core adult audience. Still, there continued to be a heavy demand for the kind of ambience adult contemporary radio provided, and it remained a well-entrenched style into the new millennium. Some of adult contemporary's core artists over the years include Elton John, Billy Joel, Sting, Air Supply, Michael Bolton, Phil Collins, Lionel Richie, Chicago, and Celine Dion.            "}

Apart from the occasional appearance of an artist who showed some influence from the classic singer/songwriter era, such as Joan Armatrading or Rickie Lee Jones, and a stream of \"new\" Dylans like Steve Forbert and Loudon Wainwright, there was no large audience for singer/songwriters. In the late '80s though, a new crop of singer/songwriters emerged that recalled the introspection and intimacy of the classic singer/songwriter era but added some modern pop production techniques. Heralded by the success of Suzanne Vega's 1988 hit \"Luka,\" many female artists (Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked, Shawn Colvin, Edie Brickell, and the Indigo Girls to name a few) used a similar blend of folk, pop and solid songcraft to follow Vega to the charts. The style remained popular as many male artists such as Luka Bloom and Freedy Johnston found success using a similar formula. The high point of the style's popularity was the late '90s, as the huge success of Sarah McLachlan's singer/writer-oriented Lilith Fair showed.

Guitars came to the islands in several waves, first with European sailors, then with Mexican and Spanish cowboys who were brought to the island to control an overpopulation of cattle, then finally with the Portuguese in the 1860s, who introduced the steel string guitars that are popular with slack-key players today.  The unique tunings used for slack-key guitar allow for a rich, romantic sound.  Many tunings are used, with the guitar often tuned to a major chord or tuned to contain a major 7th note or with the top two pitches a wide fifth interval apart. Gabby Pahinui helped bring slack-key guitar to the forefront of Hawaiian music with his recordings beginning in the 1940s.  Before that time, guitar was a minor instrument in Hawaiian music, with vocals and percussion being the primary sounds in traditional songs. Pahinui was hugely influential and helped mold the players who followed, including Sonny Chillingsworth, Leonard Kwan and Ray Kane, who continued to record up until the '80s and '90s.  A new generation of slack-key players, including Keola Beamer, Ledward Kaapana and Peter Moon came to prominence in the '70s and continued to record into the next millennium.            "}

Outside influences have impacted Hawaiian music since foreign colonizers arrived on the island in the late 18th century, all bringing sounds from their homelands that would be adopted and mixed into the island's folk music. Hawaii's tourism boom of the 1930s popularized the island's music on the mainland while the 1940s and '50s found artists like Sol Hoopii crossing over to the pop charts by bringing jazz and big band music into the mix. Don Ho became the island's unofficial musical ambassador to the world with his easy-listening blend in the 1960s. The \"Hawaiian Renaissance\" movement of the 1970s favored traditional elements and traditional artists, but rock and soul music was still popular with the younger generation and remained influential into the 21st century. Besides a healthy rock scene, Hawaii is also home to a growing number of hip-hop artists who use the Hawaiian language in their lyrics. Jawaiian music -- a mix of reggae and Hawaiian music -- exploded on the island in the 1990s and introduced the artist Israel Kamakawiwo'ole. Like many Hawaiian pop artists, superstar Kamakawiwo'ole -- or \"IZ\" -- borrowed from numerous popular genres while retaining distinctive elements from the traditional music of the island.

Distinguished by reverb-drenched guitar, rolling instrumentals that were designed to sound like crashing waves, and simple, three-chord songs, the music may sound similar on the surface, but it was revolutionary music for its time, exploring sonic territories previously unheard in rock music. The first wave of surf rock was kicked off by Dick Dale and his single \"Let's Go Trippin.\" The single was a local hit in California, but it inspired countless bands to form -- groups like the Chantays and Surfaris, who had national hits (\"Pipeline\" and \"Wipe Out,\" respectively). Nearly all of these groups were one-hit wonders that struggled to produce a second hit single. The second wave of surf rock was led by the Beach Boys, who added Four Freshmen-style pop harmonies to the basic Chuck Berry rhythms of surf rock. Groups like Jan & Dean and Ronny & the Daytonas followed, but the Beach Boys remained the ultimate surf band for many listeners, simply because they put the appeal of the beach and surfing into words instead of conveying it with impressionistic music. Nevertheless, the sounds of the instrumental surf rock echoed throughout the sonic experimentations of '60s guitarists, and the genre remained popular into the '90s, thanks to the efforts of several generations of surf-rock revivalists.

The first rockabilly revival culminated with the success of the Stray Cats in the early '80s. Following the Stray Cats crossover success, a number of rockabilly bands appeared in the American underground during the late '80s; there were also a number of rockabilly bands that were associated with the roots-rock and blues-rock scenes, not the alternative scene.

{"title": "Rockabilly", "url": "https://www.allmusic.com/style/rockabilly-ma0000002831", "discription": "                Rockabilly was a wild, hepped-up meeting between country & western music and early rhythm & blues. It was one of the very first forms of rock & roll, and it was the first one performed predominantly by white musicians (almost all of whom came from the South). Rockabilly was played with spare instrumentation: a twangy electric guitar and an acoustic stand-up bass whose strings were snapped percussively in a technique dubbed \"slap-back\" (which sometimes made drums unnecessary). Rockabilly had a thumping, jumping beat that easily made it the most propulsive, visceral, and implicitly sexual style of \"white\" American music up to that point. Essentially, it made rock & roll accessible to white audiences, thus touching off a cultural revolution the effects of which are still being felt. The genesis of rockabilly dates back to the early '50s, when Bill Haley started fusing electrified country boogie with jump blues. But the style truly crystallized on Elvis Presley's 1954-56 recordings for the Sun label, which captured the manic, primal energy that would become a rockabilly staple. They also established rockabilly's signature production style: echoed vocals, loads of reverb, and a warm, crisp ambience that became the Sun label's trademark. Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\" broke rockabilly into the big time in 1955, making it possible for Sun owner Sam Phillips to sell Presley's contract to RCA for a substantial sum of money. Presley became a superstar in 1956, touching off a tidal wave of copycat recordings that, while low on budget and innovation, still inspire rockabilly fanatics with their crazed DIY enthusiasm; additionally, many straight country singers began making rockabilly records, some for the style's popularity, others for its wild excitement. Meanwhile, Phillips used his Presley dollars to gather a stable of rockabilly artists that was second to none: Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis (who broke from the rockabilly norm by playing piano), Roy Orbison, and singers like Johnny Cash and Charlie Rich who were really country artists at heart. Other significant rockabilly artists were Buddy Holly, who brought melodic pop sensibilities to the music; Gene Vincent, whose crack band featured rockabilly's fastest lead guitarist in Cliff Gallup; Eddie Cochran, whose wry stories of teenage rebellion were overshadowed by his untimely death; and Johnny Burnette, who waxed some of the wildest rockabilly sides ever before finding greater acceptance as a pop idol. As rock & roll evolved into a slicker commercial enterprise, and as the music itself mutated (very quickly) into new forms, rockabilly was left in the dust, largely disappearing from the charts after 1958. However, as the \"roll\" was slowly siphoned out of rock & roll over the coming decades, artists looking for ways to lend their music a certain raunchiness frequently returned to rockabilly's madly swinging, hip-rolling beat. In the early '80s, there was a full-fledged rockabilly revival; some groups, like the Stray Cats, played up the retro-'50s stylization and greaser image, while others, like the Cramps, loved the raw, crude, amateurish side of the music (usually adding a campy flair) that created a modern subgenre known as psychobilly.

Early rock & roll drew from a variety of sources, primarily blues, R&B, and country, but also gospel, traditional pop, jazz, and folk. All of these influences combined in a simple, blues-based song structure that was fast, danceable, and catchy. The first wave of rock & rollers -- Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly, Bo Diddley, Bill Haley, Gene Vincent, the Everly Brothers, and Carl Perkins, among many others -- set the template for rock & roll that was followed over the next four decades. During each decade, a number of artists replicated the sound of the first rockers, while some expanded that definition and others completely exploded the constrictions of the genre. From the British Invasion, folk-rock, psychedelia, and through hard rock, heavy metal, glam rock, and punk, most subgenres of rock & roll initially demonstrated an allegiance to the basic structure of rock & roll. Once these permutations emerged, traditional rock & roll faded away from the pop charts, yet there were always artists that kept the flame alive. Some, like the Rolling Stones and the Faces, adhered to the basic rules of traditional rock & roll but played the music fast and loose. Others, like proto-punk rockers the Velvet Underground, the New York Dolls, and the Stooges, kept the basic song structure, but played it with more menace. Still others, like Dave Edmunds and Graham Parker, became rock & roll traditionalists, writing and recording music that never wavered from the sound of the late '50s and early '60s. Although the term \"rock & roll\" came to refer to a number of different music styles in the decades following its inception, the essential form of the music never changed.            "}

Sometimes, they were faithful to the letter, writing songs about dances and rock & roll with no irony; other times, the new tunes were laced with humor.

But there were some crucial differences, particularly in approach. If pub rock is anything, it is loose and unpretentious -- these were guys that played music for the hell of it. The members of the major pub rock bands -- Brinsley Schwarz, Ducks Deluxe, Bees Make Honey, Ace, Dr. Feelgood -- came from a variety of musical backgrounds, including folk-rock, blues, country-rock, and traditional rock & roll. This kind of rootsy music stood in direct contrast to the glam rock, hard rock, and prog rock that dominated the British charts. Consequently, the groups had trouble finding places to play, and they had to create their own circuit by playing hidden-away pubs throughout England. In no time, the unconventional venues and their defiantly good-time, back-to-basics rock & roll became a rallying cry for pub rockers. None of the pub-rock bands became stars or had hits, but their do-it-yourself attitude and stripped-down sound -- as well as the creation of the pub-rock circuit itself -- paved the way for punk rock. Indeed, many pub rockers -- including Brinsley Schwarz's Nick Lowe, the 101ers' Joe Strummer, Flip City's Elvis Costello, Kilburn & the High Roads' Ian Dury and Graham Parker -- became important figures in punk and new wave just a few years after the pub-rock scene faded in the mid-'70s.

Influenced by the Chicano movement emphasizing culture and heritage, an assortment of California-based bands began incorporating Spanish-language material and the percussion forms of Latin America. Though Santana and War were the only successful bands, great recordings were also made by Malo, Tierra, and El Chicano, as well as bands from New York (Ocho, Mandrill, Eddie Palmieri's Harlem River Drive) and even Peru (Black Sugar).

They were synthesists, borrowing elements of everything from classic rock and bluegrass to soul jazz and Sting & Paul Simon's worldbeat explorations. The first jam bands -- Blues Traveler, Widespread Panic, Spin Doctors, among others -- were more rock-oriented, but as the decade rolled on and more bands were formed, the genre's diversity deepened.

That wasn't always the case, however, and if the melodies were strong enough, rock & roll instrumentals could catch on and become hits. That happened most frequently during rock's first decade of existence, which constituted a sort of golden age for Instrumental Rock in the years before the British Invasion. The lead melodies of hit instrumentals could emphasize the organ (the Tornados' \"Telstar\") or the saxophone (the Champs' \"Tequila\"), but most often it was the guitar, as the twangy sound of Duane Eddy, the visceral fuzz tone of Link Wray, and the clean, reverbed picking of the Ventures all had a tremendous impact on many of the rock guitarists who followed them (Eddy and the Ventures scored quite a few hit singles as well). The Ventures were especially influential on the development of surf music, which -- apart from groups like the Beach Boys and Jan & Dean -- usually consisted of heavily reverbed guitar instrumentals. Despite the rapid-fire picking and Middle Eastern scales sometimes employed by surf-guitar innovator Dick Dale, most surf music was fairly simple, retaining its melodic emphasis. Following the British Invasion, instrumental hits were mostly confined to the R&B realm, among artists like Booker T. & the MG's and saxophonist Junior Walker. Funk and disco produced several instrumental hit singles during the '70s, and the technical virtuosity of many art-rockers led its fans to prize instrumental work, even if most of the songs featured vocals at one point or another. That emphasis on technical skill carried over into the '80s, when highly trained guitar virtuosos began to dominate heavy metal and even (like Joe Satriani and Steve Vai) record their own albums. During the '90s, instrumental music made a comeback in the indie-rock community, led by eclectic, avant-garde post-rock combos like Tortoise, as well as surf-rock revivalists like Man or Astro-Man?.

Hot rod had a handful of hits, but it never really became the sensation surf was because it was surf music.

At its core, heartland rock was straightforward rock & roll infused with Americana -- more streamlined than garage rock, but not as traditionalist as roots rock. Ironically for a style so distinctly American, the Rolling Stones was a clear influence on most of the rough & tumble rockers. But the Stones weren't the only main influence -- so were the Byrds, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, and '60s garage rock. The result was a frequently exciting hybrid of melody, rhythm, and message. Although heartland rock wasn't solely political -- almost every heartland artist had a pile-driving, good-time rocker -- it all was united by the attitude that music should be about something. Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, John Mellencamp, and Bob Seger epitomized heartland, but they were hardly the only heartland rockers. There were critically-acclaimed rockers of the late '70s and early '90s, like Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes and Joe Grushecky & the Houserockers. In the '80s, the genre also encompassed such singer/songwriters as Bruce Hornsby, whose music didn't really rock, but certainly shared a similar aesthetic to Springsteen's quieter moments. During the '90s, the genre faded somewhat, as many bands that would have been a heartland outfit at the beginning of the '80s chose to follow an Americana route, but there were still pockets where the faithful kept the flame burning.

Blues-rock emphasized two specific things -- the traditional, three-chord blues song and instrumental improvisation. Borrowing the idea of an instrumental combo and loud amplification from rock & roll, the original blues-rockers -- bands like Cream that grew out of the Alexis Korner and John Mayall tradition of British blues, as well as American bands like the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and Canned Heat -- also attempted to play long, involved improvisations which were commonplace on jazz records, as well as live blues shows. The hybrid became quite popular and the bands that immediately followed them were louder and more riff-oriented. Out of this approach came heavy metal and Southern rock, which both used basic blues riffs and featured extended solos. In the early '70s, the lines between blues-rock and hard rock were barely visible, as boogie-based bands like ZZ Top employed album-rock production techniques that tended to obscure their blues roots. However, blues-rock soon backed away from hard rock, and there was a set number of acts that continued to play (and rewrite) blues standards as well as write their own songs in the same idiom. In the '80s and '90s, blues-rock was more roots-oriented than in the '60s and '70s, even when artists like the Fabulous Thunderbirds and Stevie Ray Vaughan flirted with rock stardom.

Hard rock, prog-rock, and (later) punk either ignored or reformulated rock traditions, according to very different aesthetics. But outside of the prevailing trends, there was still a small audience who loved old-fashioned, good-time rock & roll. That sort of music was the primary influence for the bar band style, a genial brand of rock & roll equally suited to dancing, drinking, partying, or just hanging out. Bar bands drew mostly from early rock & roll and R&B (particularly Chuck Berry and Little Richard), but also from other artists who'd reinterpreted and updated those sounds, like the Rolling Stones, the Faces, Bruce Springsteen, and Bob Seger. The longest-lived (and most eclectic) bar band was Florida's NRBQ, who recorded throughout the '70s (and far beyond); the style also had a rough British equivalent in the '70s pub rock movement. But the style really took off when Bruce Springsteen's '70s albums helped reinvigorate old-time rock & roll in the eyes of both critics and the public; Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes, Joe Grushecky & the Houserockers, and John Cafferty & the Beaver Brown Band were some of the bar bands who scored record deals in Springsteen's wake. Bar bands reached their greatest popularity in the '80s, when the similar Heartland rock and roots rock styles were at their peak, and when groups like Huey Lewis & the News and the Georgia Satellites scored major hit singles.

The Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers were the twin precursors of American trad rock, even though there are hints of the Stones and the Faces thrown in every once in a while as well. The very first U.S. trad rockers -- the Georgia Satellites and the Black Crowes -- appeared in the mid- to late '80s and had grown out of roots rock. By the early '90s, American trad rock had begun to take shape as Allman soundalikes like Widespread Panic began cultivating followings, and by the middle of the decade, there was a loose collective of similar-minded, neo-Dead bands (Blues Traveler, Phish) that had built a fanbase by touring constantly.

In the early '80s, a number of bands -- primarily British and heavily influenced by Roxy Music and David Bowie -- adapted the electronic innovations of bands like Kraftwerk for pop songs. Initially, in the hands of artists like Gary Numan, the Human League, and Depeche Mode, the sound was eerie, sterile, and vaguely menacing, since the electronics droned on relentlessly without any change in inflections. However, these first stabs at synth pop were transformed into danceable, synthesized pop by Duran Duran, who made the synthesized hooks warmer and catchier by grafting them onto a dance beat. Soon, a flood of bands followed Duran Duran's lead and although some of the groups weren't as infectious as that band, they nevertheless relied on the conventions of three-minute pop. Duran Duran became stars, while most other synth-pop groups were lucky to have more than one hit. There were some exceptions -- the Human League and Eurythmics had several hits, as did Howard Jones -- but the field was mainly occupied by one-hit wonders like A Flock of Seagulls. By 1984, synth pop had begun to die out, but the music had helped establish the synthesizer as a primary instrument in mainstream pop music during its time in the spotlight.            "}

MacKaye eventually backed off,  stating that he had not meant to start a movement , but the ideas resonated loud and clear  through the national hardcore punk underground, and other disaffected punks got involved and started scenes in New York, Los Angeles and Arizona (to name a few).  Longevity was achieved with straight-edge's peak in 1988, with bands like Youth of Today, Seven Seconds and Gorilla Biscuits making the music more accessible by taking the basic hardcore riffs and adding melodic and metallic tones.

Instead of mimicking the sound of the R&B, the first ska artists developed a distinctive rhythmic and melodic sensibility, which eventually turned into reggae music. In the late '70s, a number of young British bands began reviving the sound of original ska, adding a nervous punk edge to the skittish rhythms. Furthermore, the Ska Revivalists were among the only bands of the era to feature racially integrated lineups, which was a bold political statement for the time. Indeed, ska revival was more implicitly political than any of their British punk and new wave contemporaries. The leading ska revivalist band was the Specials, who formed their own independent label, 2-Tone. Led by Jerry Dammers and fronted by Terry Hall, the Specials established the sound and approach for all of the bands that followed, and were an immediate hit in England. Through 2-Tone and a variety of tours, the Specials helped cultivate an active ska revival scene -- the group offered support for all of the major ska revivalists that followed, including Madness, the (English) Beat, and Selecter. Throughout the early '80s, ska revival bands, particularly Madness, were very popular in the U.K. The groups didn't make much headway in the States until 1982 and 1983, when MTV aired videos by all of the important (and many of the lesser) bands. By that time, most of the bands had run their peak and it was just a matter of months before the Specials, Madness, the (English) Beat, and Selecter all broke up. Although the ska revival bands never became stars outside of the U.K., they did become major cult figures in the U.S. and inspired several generations of musicians to form similar bands. This wave of ska revivalists was equally inspired by hardcore punk and heavy metal, thereby stripping out much of the R&B groove that informed the original ska and 2-Tone artists. Nevertheless, these bands -- including Rancid, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and No Doubt -- became quite popular in America during the mid-'90s. In the U.K., ska revivalists influenced both Britpop bands like Blur and trip-hop artists like Tricky.            "}

Obviously, none of these artists could be classified as proto-punk until long after the fact; it was never a cohesive movement, nor was there a readily identifiable proto-punk sound that made its artists seem related at the time. What ties proto-punk together is a certain provocative sensibility that didn't fit the prevailing counterculture of the time. Proto-punk challenged not only mainstream rock conventions, but the utopianism and general positivity of the hippie movement. It was consciously subversive and fully aware of its outsider status -- sometimes because the bands had arty ambitions, sometimes for the thrill of thumbing their noses. In terms of its lasting influence, much proto-punk was primitive and stripped-down, even when it wasn't aggressive, and its production was usually just as unpolished. It also frequently dealt with taboo subject matter, depicting society's grimy underbelly in great detail, and venting alienation that was more intense and personal than ever before. The first proto-punk group was the Velvet Underground, for a variety of reasons: their boundary-shattering lyrical content, their use of feedback, distortion, and white noise, their unpredictable (yet song-centered) experimentalism, their amateurish technique. Emerging around 1969, the raucous, almost amelodic rock of the MC5 and the Stooges did more to set the sonic blueprint for punk than any other bands. In the early '70s, the New York Dolls kickstarted what would become the New York punk scene with their raw, Stonesy rock and glammed-up image; around the same time, there were also some small-scale recordings that featured soon-to-be-punk poets Patti Smith, Richard Hell, and Television's Tom Verlaine. Most of the British artists who could be considered proto-punk were also part of the glam rock scene, which inspired many future punks with its simple, crunchy guitar riffs, its outrageous sense of style, and its artists' willingness to sing with British accents (not to mention the idiosyncratic images of David Bowie and Roxy Music).

It just did it louder and faster and more abrasively than any other rock & roll in the past. Although there had been several bands to flirt with what became known as punk rock -- including the garage rockers of the '60s and the Velvet Underground, the Stooges, and the New York Dolls -- it wasn't until the mid-'70s that punk became its own genre. On both sides of the Atlantic, young bands began forsaking the sonic excesses that distinguished mainstream hard rock and stripping the music down to its essentials. In New York, the first punk band was the Ramones; in London, the first punk band was the Sex Pistols. Although the bands had different agendas and sounds -- the Ramones were faster and indebted to bubblegum, while the Pistols played Faces riffs sloppier and louder than the Faces themselves -- the direct approach of the bands revolutionized music in both the U.K. and the U.S. In America, punk remained an underground sensation, eventually spawning the hardcore and indie-rock scenes of the '80s, but in the UK, it was a full-scale phenomenon. In the U.K., the Sex Pistols were thought of as a serious threat to the well-being of the government and monarchy, but more importantly, they caused countless bands to form. Some of the bands stuck close to the Pistols' original blueprint, but many found their own sound, whether it was the edgy pop of the Buzzcocks, the anthemic, reggae-informed rock of the Clash, or the arty experiments of Wire and Joy Division. Soon, punk splintered into post-punk (which was more experimental and artier than punk), new wave (which was more pop-oriented), and hardcore, which simply made punk harder, faster, and more abrasive. Throughout the '80s, punk was identified with the hardcore scenes in both America and England. In the early '90s, a wave of punk revivalists -- led by Green Day and Rancid -- emerged from the American underground. The new wave of punk rockers followed the same template as the original punks, but they tended to incorporate elements of heavy metal into their sound.            "}

Although several bands of the early '70s -- most notably the Raspberries, Big Star, and Badfinger -- established the sound of power pop, it wasn't until the late '70s that a whole group of like-minded bands emerged. Most of these groups modeled themselves on the Raspberries (which isn't entirely surprising, since they were the only power-pop band of their era to have hit singles), or they went directly back to the source and based their sound on stacks of British Invasion records. What tied all of these bands together was their love of the three-minute pop single. Power-pop bands happened to emerge around the same time of punk, so they were swept along with the new wave because their brief, catchy songs fit into the post-punk aesthetic. Out of these bands, Cheap Trick, the Knack, the Romantics, and Dwight Twilley had the biggest hits, but the Shoes, the Records, the Nerves, and 20/20, among many others, became cult favorites. During the early '80s, power pop died away as a hip movement, and nearly all of the bands broke up. However, in the late '80s, a new breed of power pop began to form. The new bands, who were primarily influenced by Big Star, blended traditional power pop with alternative rock sensibilities and sounds; in the process, groups like Teenage Fanclub, Material Issue, and the Posies became critical and cult favorites. While these bands gained the attention of hip circles, many of the original power-pop groups began recording new material and releasing it on independent labels. In the early '90s, the Yellow Pills compilation series gathered together highlights from these re-activated power poppers, as well as new artists that worked in a traditional power-pop vein. Throughout the early and mid-'90s, this group of independent, grass-roots power-pop bands gained a small but dedicated cult following in the United States.            "}

Oi! music was an attempt to keep punk a populist, street-level phenomenon; most of it came from the Cockney working class of London's East End. Likely taking its name from the Cockney Rejects' 1980 song \"Oi! Oi! Oi!\" (before which it was simply known as street-punk), Oi! was loud, brutal, and extremely simple, with loads of shout-along, almost football-chant choruses. In essence, it was punk rock that was most at home in a rowdy pub. It was somewhat similar to hardcore, but not quite as extreme; Oi! stuck much more closely to the original punk blueprint laid out by the Sex Pistols and early Clash. In fact, critics frequently disdained the style for its punk-purist lack of adventurousness, and the way its political statements often replaced the Pistols' wit and intelligence with angry rabble-rousing. The latter wasn't universally true, but all the same, Oi! acquired a bad reputation when it was adopted by racist skinheads aligned with the neo-fascist National Front organization. Most bands (and skinheads) took pains to distance themselves from this unsavory element, especially after a number of violent incidents at live gigs; however, a few genuine white-supremacist bands (most notoriously Skrewdriver) were enough to give Oi! a stigma which it never completely shed. The band that brought Oi!/street-punk to prominence in 1978-79 was Sham 69, and they in turn gave career pushes to Oi! stalwarts like the Angelic Upstarts and the Cockney Rejects. The mid-'90s punk revival led to a renewal of interest in Oi!; many favorite early albums were reissued, and a number of new bands popped up both in the U.K. and overseas.            "}

Like the post-punk movement that was primarily centered in Britain, no wave drew from the artier side of punk -- but where British post-punk was mostly cold and despairing, no wave was harsh, abrasive, and aggressively confrontational. Most no wave bands were fascinated by the pure noise that could be produced by an electric guitar, making it an important component of their music (and oftentimes the central focus). Unlike punk, melody was as unimportant as instrumental technique, as most no wavers concentrated on producing an atonal, dissonant (yet often rhythmic) racket. With its assaultive artiness and theatrical angst, no wave was as much performance art as it was music. Two of no wave's central figures were vocalist/guitarist Lydia Lunch and saxophonist James Chance, who performed together in Teenage Jesus and the Jerks; Lunch went on to a long solo career, and Chance formed an innovative no wave/funk outfit called the Contortions. The defining no wave recording is the 1978 Brian Eno-produced compilation No New York, which features material from Chance and the Contortions, Teenage Jesus, DNA (featuring avant-garde guitarist Arto Lindsay), and Mars. Although none of the no wave performers ever really broke out to wider audiences (Lunch's prolific, collaboration-heavy solo output brought her the closest), Sonic Youth fused no wave's distorted cacophony with the more meditative noise explorations of guitarist/avant-garde composer Glenn Branca, and became underground legends after adding more melodic structure to the sound.

The Dolls helped open the doors for a raft of musical misfits, most importantly the Ramones, a quartet from Queens clad in jeans and leather who appropriated catchy hooks from early-'60s bubblegum, surf, and girl-group pop, but played them as loud, fast, and raw as possible. Their sound was basic (two-minute, three-chord rockers) and stripped-down (just guitar, bass, and drums), and their attitude -- bringing a sense of dumb fun back to rock & roll -- stood in sharp contrast to nearly every prevailing musical trend of the '70s. The Ramones became regulars at CBGB's, a dive bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side that became, along with Max's Kansas City, the epicenter for the developing punk scene around 1975-76. Although the Ramones still epitomize the sound most listeners (especially Americans) think of as \"punk rock,\" the New York scene was in actuality much more diverse, united by a common spirit of reinventing and reinvigorating rock & roll than by any one sound. Television, for example, stretched their songs into ambitiously intricate, epic-length twin-guitar duels; lead singer Tom Verlaine's literary bent was echoed in the work of his ex-bandmate Richard Hell and singer/poet Patti Smith. Meanwhile, Blondie's subversions of girl-group pop and the Talking Heads' quirky art-school guitar-pop were some of the first ventures into what would eventually be called new wave, but their attitudes placed them squarely in the punk camp at the time. Also on the dividing line was synth-pop duo Suicide, whose incendiary performances and edgy subject matter made them perhaps the most confrontational band on the scene. There was no formula, but there was no lasting scene either - by the early '80s, much of the activity had died down, as the original bands began to hit the mainstream, fade away, or settle into cult roles.

In retrospect, it became clear that the music following punk could be divided, more or less, into two categories -- post-punk and new wave. Where post-punk was arty, difficult, and challenging, new wave was pop music, pure and simple. It retained the fresh vigor and irreverence of punk music, as well as a fascination with electronics, style, and art. Therefore, there was a lot of stylistic diversity to new wave. It meant the nervy power pop of bands like XTC and Nick Lowe, but it also meant synth rockers like Gary Numan or rock revivalists like Graham Parker and Rockpile. There were edgy new wave songwriters like Elvis Costello, pop bands like Squeeze, tough rock & rollers like the Pretenders, pop-reggae like the Police, mainstream rockers like the Cars, and ska revivalists like the Specials and Madness. As important as these major artists were, there were also countless one-hit wonders that emerged during early new wave. These one-hit groups were as diverse as the major artists, but they all shared a love of pop hooks, modernist, synthesized production, and a fascination for being slightly left of center. By the early '80s, new wave described nearly every new pop/rock artist, especially those that used synthesizers like the Human League and Duran Duran. New wave received a boost in the early '80s by MTV, who broadcast endless hours of new wave videos in order to keep themselves on the air. Therefore, new wave got a second life in 1982, when it probably would have died out. Instead, 1982 and 1983 were boom years for polished, MTV-radio new wave outfits like Culture Club, Adam Ant, Spandau Ballet, Haircut 100, and A Flock of Seagulls. New wave finally died out in 1984, when established artists began to make professional videos and a new crop of guitar-oriented bands like the Smiths and R.E.M. emerged to capture the attention of college-radio and underground rock fans. Nevertheless, new wave proved more influential than many of its critics would have suspected, as the mid-'90s were dominated by bands -- from Blur to Weezer -- that were raised on the music.

The Mod Revivalists stuck to the R&B-informed rock & roll that distinguished the original '60s mods, but the sound was harder and more frenetic, and often only implied the music's R&B roots. Since the original wave of mod bands in the '60s only included a few of bands -- the Small Faces, the Who, the Creation, and the Action, as well as a handful of others -- there were actually more mod groups in the revival than there were in the '60s. Furthermore, since most of the original mods only performed in cover bands (with the exception of the aforementioned groups) or simply danced to Motown records, the revival was the first wave of mod bands to rely on original material. Nevertheless, the mod revival only produced a handful of popular bands. The Jam were the most popular band in Britain during the late '70s and early '80s, but groups like the Lambrettas, the Merton Parkas, Squire, and Purple Hearts managed to cultivate cult followings and occasionally have pop hits. The mod revival lasted as long as the Jam's career -- after Paul Weller disbanded the trio to form the Style Council, most mod revivalists either split up or became new romantics, which usually resulted in a breakup as well. Despite its brief time in the spotlight, the mod revival had a lasting impact on British pop music, as many of the most popular English rock bands of the '80s and '90s -- from the Smiths to Blur and Oasis -- was indebted either to the Jam or to the movement in general.

For these purposes, though, L.A. punk refers to the original, pre-hardcore punks, who played a generally lean and mean brand of punk already. Most L.A. punk was fast and thrashy, with an overall tougher vibe than the often arty New York scene or the young and impassioned amateursin London. The major exception was X, whose off-kilter male/female harmony vocals, rockabilly rhythms, and ambitiously literate lyrics would have been a perfect fit with the CBGB's regulars. Other major contributors to the L.A. sound included the angry socialist politics of the Dils, the amateurish proto-hardcore and angst-ridden poetry of the Germs, and the gonzo humor of the Weirdos and the Dickies. With its natural inclination toward more aggressive punk, L.A. became the center for the music's shift into hardcore, with Black Flag (and, later, its seminal SST label) leading the new direction by the beginning of the '80s.

Washington DC, Boston, and San Francisco played massive roles in the growth of the genre. Emerging in the early '80s, with the ideals of traditional punk firmly in tow, the blueprint for Hardcore was simple: play it louder, play it harder, and play it faster. The music was relentless, the songs were brief, the riffs were basic, the vocals were shouted or screamed, and the records looked (and sounded) like they were made in someone's basement. Many actually were, and the do-it-yourself (D.I.Y.) aesthetic that was later embraced by grunge and indie rock traces back to the early days of hardcore. Black Flag's Greg Ginn, Dead Kennedys' Jello Biafra, and Minor Threat's Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson started influential labels Alternative Tentacles, SST, and Dischord on shoestring budgets in order to put out their respective band's 7\" records and home-recorded cassettes. Hardcore shows were often promoted with photocopied flyers, fanzines, and by word of mouth, as the underground fan base became increasingly devoted. For many, the term \"hardcore\" became a way of life, synonymous with shaved heads, slam dancing (later, moshing), sociopolitical ideals, and a stern attitude. Hardcore kept going into the '90s without ever breaking into the mainstream, though bands influenced by the hardcore aesthetic (including Nirvana and Green Day) became major rock stars, and former hardcore punkers like Bob Mould, Henry Rollins, Mike Watt, Ian McKaye, and Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis became alternative icons. After spawning various similar-minded genres -- skate punk, speed metal, thrash, grunge, sludge metal, and metalcore, among others -- hardcore continued to flourish on a smaller scale through the 2000s.

More than any other post-punk genre, new romantics relied on style and glamour. Duran Duran was the ultimate new romantic group, and they were the only one to become superstars.

But a number of punk bands who followed took that credo to heart, railing not just against authority but the very idea of government (or, at least, its hypocrisies and abuses of power). Anarchist punk sometimes came from the far left wing (the Dead Kennedys), sometimes from the downtrodden, Thatcher-era working class (the Exploited), and sometimes both; regardless of its origins, it was unified by its radical politics. Most anarchist punk was an offshoot of hardcore punk, since both emerged around the same time, and anarchist punk usually resided on the rougher, more amateurish end of the spectrum. Part of the reason was its ideology of personal freedom (musical self-expression ought to be available to anyone, regardless of technical ability), and also that the message tended to be more important than the music. But it was also important to drive home that message with sounds that were as extreme as the statements -- so, anarchist punk was generally played as loud, fast, and thrashy as the band members' technical skills allowed. The definitive anarchist punk band was Crass, both for their crashing, barely structured music and for the communal lifestyle its members lived in support of their politics.            "}

British punk was partly inspired by the back-to-basics rock & roll of the pub rock movement and the anything-goes theatrics of glam rock, but the main catalysts were early New York punks like the Ramones and the New York Dolls. Arriving in a class-conscious country struggling through an economic downturn, punk seemed to threaten the very fabric of British society, giving voice to the rage of the lower class and the dissatisfaction of the nation's youth. And it did so in the loudest, fastest, most confrontational way possible. The first and most influential British punk band was the Sex Pistols, who hit the scene in 1976 and made an immediate impact by directly inspiring just about every British punk group that followed. Their simple, raw, stripped-down guitar riffs set the blueprint for much British punk, and their provocative, playfully subversive rhetoric got them demonized in the press and even physically attacked on the streets. The other key British punk band was the Clash, who were not only the most politically idealistic group on the scene, but also the most musically eclectic, incorporating early rock & roll and reggae. Yet even early on, the scene was quite diverse: the Buzzcocks wrote tense punk-pop tunes full of witty romantic confessions; the Jam tempered their social criticism with mod-inflected celebrations of British youth; the Damned were a riotous bunch of yobs who beat out the Sex Pistols to release the first British punk single (\"New Rose\"); and X-Ray Spex was just one group to prominently feature female members. Regardless of their musical approach or lyrical subjects, what these and other British punk artists shared was a crackling energy, a distaste for the overblown mainstream music of the time, and a liberating sense that anyone -- regardless of technical skill -- could pick up an instrument, get on stage, say whatever was on their minds, and bash out some glorious noise. The Sex Pistols and the Clash both signed with major labels, the only outlets then available; however, their D.I.Y. aesthetic helped create a thriving independent music scene around the U.K. The first wave of British punk ended with the Sex Pistols' breakup in January 1978, but the scene remained fertile -- and its sounds recognizably punk -- until about 1982. By that time, the remaining original punks had expanded their sounds, and British punk itself had mutated and splintered into a number of subgenres: pop-oriented new wave, arty and challenging post-punk, icy and forbidding goth-rock, anarchist hardcore punk, and early alternative rock.

But for all intents and purposes, American punk truly begins with the Ramones, around 1975-76. A thriving, often artsy punk scene sprang up around the Ramones in New York City, and similar movements took shape in Los Angeles, where the music was more aggressive and closer to what would become hardcore punk; Cleveland, which tended to be weirder and more experimental, partly due to the lack of media attention; and Boston, which was often closer to garagey power-pop than true punk. New York remained the focal point of American punk, however, featuring most of the style's best-known and/or most influential artists: Television, Richard Hell, Patti Smith, Blondie, Talking Heads, Cleveland transplants the Dead Boys, etc. By the early '80s, American punk had either faded away or morphed into new forms: hardcore punk, new wave, and early alternative rock. American punk didn't supply the immediate pop-music revolution that British punk did, but it continued to nourish American underground rock for decades, and a California-centered revival of the form -- heavily reliant on the Ramones -- became extremely popular during the '90s.

Instead of confining themselves to the brief, concise verse-chorus-verse patterns of rock & roll, they moved toward more free-form, fluid song structures. Just as important -- if not more so -- the groups began incorporating elements of Indian and Eastern music and free-form jazz to their sound, as well as experimenting with electronically altering instruments and voices within the recording studio. Initially, around 1965 and 1966, bands like the Yardbirds and the Byrds broke down the boundaries for psychedelia, creating swirling  layers of fuzz-toned guitars, sitars, and chanted vocals. Soon, numerous groups followed their pattern, including the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, both of whom recorded psychedelia in 1966. In no time, groups on both sides of the Atlantic embraced the possibilities of the new genre, and the differences were notable. In Britain, psychedelia tended to be whimsical and surrealistic. Nevertheless, bands -- most notably Pink Floyd and Traffic -- played extended instrumentals that relied on improvisation as much as their American contemporaries the Grateful Dead, the Doors, Love, and Jefferson Airplane. In other corners of America, garage bands began playing psychedelic rock without abandoning their raw, amateurish foundation of three-chord rock -- they just layered in layers of distortion, feedback, and effects. Eventually, psychedelic evolved into acid rock, heavy metal, and art rock, but there continued to be revivals of psychedelia in the decades that followed, most notably in the American underground of the mid-'80s.

It didn't take too long -- once the Beatles delved into the style on 1966's Revolver, it was just a matter of time. Where straight psychedelic music actively pushed boundaries, psychedelic pop, by and large, took those innovations and applied them to concise, catchy pop songs. The psychedelic effects were used as trippy dressing -- sitars, fuzz guitars, tape effects, backward guitars, even Beach Boys harmonies, were all blended into something trippy, but usually not too freaky, since the tight song structures and melodies gave everything a framework. At times, psychedelic pop songs were studio creations, but there were organic bands such as Sagittarius whose psychedelia was considerably bright and melodic; there were distinct Beach Boys influences, but they weren't as bubblegum as, say, the Lemon Pipers' \"Green Tambourine.\" Because it had a stronger pop content, psychedelic pop had a slightly longer shelf-life than psychedelia, existing into the early '70s, which is a little odd. What's even stranger is that some psychedelic pop is more interesting than average psychedelia, since it had weird, occasionally awkward blends of psychedelia and pop conventions -- the Neon Philharmonic's 1969 album The Moth Confesses is a prime example of this.

Early Pop/Rock emerged in the late '50s, as the initial rock & roll craze began to die down, and a lighter, smoother (but still similar) alternative to rock was needed.

They didn't have the raw sexuality of Elvis Presley, nor did they have his instinctive vocal talents. The teen idols were carefully groomed and given inoffensive, catchy material to sing. Pat Boone was the first of the teen idols of the late '50s. Boone primarily covered rock & roll and R&B hits, but his clean-cut good looks and smooth vocals set the stage for singers like Paul Anka, who primarily sang ballads that were given contemporary pop/rock productions. Ricky Nelson emerged at the same time as Anka, and out of all the teen idols, his music remained the closest to rock & roll -- Nelson performed rockabilly, R&B, and rock & roll, but he played with professional studio musicians who helped give the music a cleaner attack. After Anka and Nelson, the golden age of teen idols emerged, as a number of vocalists with limited vocal skills but good looks became stars. These vocalists -- like Fabian and Frankie Avalon -- sang songs written by professional songwriters. Frequently, this material hearkened back to the Tin Pan Alley and traditional pop that dominated the early '50s, but the records were given rock & roll productions. Teen idols continued to be popular throughout the early '60s and the genre went through a number of fads, including a string of teenage television actors who turned into singers, as well as a wave of melodramatic songs about tragic teenage deaths. Rockers like Gene Pitney, Dion, and Del Shannon were packaged as teen idols, but their music was substantial enough to essentially sustain the death of the fad in 1963. Furthermore, there were a number of British teen idols -- such as Cliff Richard and Adam Faith -- who dominated the charts in the same era with similar music, but they all faded away upon the arrival of the Beatles in 1963. During the '70s, the term came to describe a number of AM-pop artists like the Bay City Rollers and Shaun Cassidy, who essentially updated the lightweight approach of '60s teen idols for the '70s.

Genres covered by pop idols often include (but aren't limited to) schlager, dance-pop, teen pop, vocal pop, country pop, and alternative pop/rock. Many pop idols find chart success, however fleeting, following their time in competitions -- regardless of whether they win or lose -- which resulted in many one-hit wonders in the late '90s and early 2000s. Not every singer or band who participates in a song contest necessarily falls into the pop idol category. The Finnish metal band Lordi, for instance, won the Eurovision Song Contest in 2006, but they wouldn't normally be considered pop idols in the same sense that someone like Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, or Andy Abraham are considered pop idols.

Pop as a musical style, however, began in the late '90s and early 2000s, when a pair of major forces began narrowing and focusing commercial tastes. First, the heavy influence of rap and R&B made the pop singles charts more homogeneous than ever. Then, the advent of the television contest American Idol further centralized what people agreed on as pop music. As such, Pop is primarily influenced by the time's two most broadly popular styles: R&B and adult contemporary. The sound of Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears in the mid-to-late '90s was of prime importance to the genesis of Pop, as were R&B superstars Aaliyah and R. Kelly, both of whom had a heavy adult contemporary angle to their material. By the 2000s, a parade of varying artists were catering to the mainstream with a similar type of pop music -- artists as diverse as Destiny's Child, Black Eyed Peas, Faith Hill, Maroon 5, Keith Urban, and AmIdol alums like Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken. Not everything they recorded was Pop, but in varying degrees they included several bids to the mainstream each year and on each album. Although the essentials of songcraft were still much in abundance, their songs were as much about production as performance.            "}

Though there were strong elements of rock & roll and R&B in the music, the girl group sound was decidedly more polished than earlier forms of rock & roll. It was driven by producers and songwriters, who helped guided the groups and gave them material to sing. The vocalists had roots in gospel and R&B, while the songwriters and producers were schooled in traditional pop, which resulted in an exciting hybrid. The songs were innocent and yearning, with sweet, catchy melodies and driving backbeats.

But pure pop took a while to become comfortable with rock's insistent backbeat, and it wasn't until the dawn of the '70s -- around the time when rock & roll's first-generation fans were settling into adulthood -- that truly equal pop/rock fusions became the epitome of mainstream music (as opposed to pre-rock vocal pop, which still commanded a sizable adult audience for most of the '60s). Naturally, pop/rock's primary focus was on melody -- as big, catchy, and instantly memorable as possible, whether the song was a rocker, ballad, or midtempo in-betweener. But the other, less immediately apparent aspect of pop/rock was its emphasis on the professional craft of record-making. The songs were tightly constructed, with no wasted space or prolonged detours from the melodic hooks. The production was clean, polished, and bright, making full use of the advances in recording technology (and technique) that had taken place over the course of the '60s. In general, pop/rock was catchy and energetic enough to appeal to younger listeners, but clean and safe enough for adults as well. Pop/rock, however, was not soft rock; it's important to realize -- hard as it may be to imagine today -- that the big hooks, rock instrumentation, and definite backbeat gave pop/rock an energy that would have been too edgy for more conservative listeners who hadn't grown up with rock & roll. Naturally, with its commercial accessibility, pop/rock produced some of the biggest stars of the '70s, such as Elton John, Peter Frampton, Paul McCartney & Wings, and Fleetwood Mac; it continued on into the '80s with Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, Hall & Oates, George Michael, and many others. In the '90s, pop/rock became largely the province of well-established veterans, as alternative rock, urban R&B, hip-hop, and teen pop took over the pop charts to the exclusion of most everything else.

Bubblegum was targeted at a preteen audience whose older siblings had been raised on rock & roll. It was simple, melodic, and light as feather -- neither the lyrics or the music had much substance. Bubblegum was a manufactured music, created by record producers that often hired session musicians to play and sing the songs. Frequently, the session musicians were given a fake band name to give the illusion that they were a real group. Apart from acts like the Partridge Family and Tommy Roe, most bubblegum groups were one-hit wonders. Appropriately, the genre also had a short life span, lasting roughly five years. As those preteen bubblegum fans grew up, they left the music behind. However, the genre had a surprisingly long legacy, as musicians that grew up with bubblegum created songs that reflected the sunny, catchy simplicity of the music.            "}

The songs were indebted not only to rock & roll and R&B, but also Tin Pan Alley pop, as the sophisticated lyrics and melodies proved. The productions on these early '60s records were also more sophisticated than most rock & roll records, featuring orchestras and bands with large rhythm and guitar sections.

Layered harmonies, strings, and horns are all hallmarks of baroque pop, as is the music's dramatic intensity.

AM was the more tightly programmed, singles-oriented band on the dial, and it played the sort of commercial pop music that has since become synonymous with the era. Some AM pop singles appeal to modern ears only as embarrassingly kitschy artifacts of their time, far too dippily cheerful (or maudlin, as the case may be) for their own good. But AM pop wasn't just about bubblegum and mellow pop -- there was also room for soul, British Invasion rock, post-psychedelic pop, country-rock and country-pop, folk-rock, and even occasional hard rock (provided it was concise, catchy, and not too heavy). Also, it delivered songs by most of the best acts of the rock and soul era: the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the powerful Motown and Brill Building stables, Neil Diamond, the Mamas & the Papas, and Simon & Garfunkel, among many others.

It isn't literally symphonic, of course; that simply refers to the thick-sounding instrumentation and sweeping, dramatic soundscapes. Nor is its connection to black metal always readily audible; although nearly all of its bands started out playing standard-issue black metal, symphonic black metal often bears little surface resemblance to its immediate forebear. The starting point for symphonic black metal was the early-'90s sound of Norwegian black metal, specifically the wing of bands that employed sorrowful, melodic keyboard lines as a counterpoint to their furious assaults. Black metal groups looking to push past the inherent limitations of the form began de-emphasizing the guitar and adding elements of progressive rock (primarily psychedelic space-rock bands like Pink Floyd) and goth metal, with its emphasis on chilling, eerie texture. The resulting sound is usually lush, and much more inviting and accessible than straightforward black metal. After outfits like Tiamat and Samael pioneered the form, a new wave of bands led by the Gathering also began incorporating ethereal female singers, sometimes as the sole vocal focus. The symphonic black metal movement remains somewhat limited, partly because of its epic ambitions and partly because it isn't traditionally metallic, but its fascinating synthesis of influences made it an instantly identifiable alternative in underground metal at the turn of the millennium.

Crossing the New Wave of British Heavy Metal with hardcore punk, speed metal was extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding -- the bands played fast, but their attack was precise and clean. In that sense, speed metal always remained true to its metal roots. But what it borrowed from hardcore -- namely, insanely fast tempos and a defiant, do-it-yourself attitude -- was equally important, since it gave the bands not only a unique musical approach but also an attractive image for legions of alienated suburban youths. Because it was so intense and technically demanding, speed metal quickly evolved into thrash, which allowed greater leeway in terms of tempo, groove, and instrumental dexterity. Led by Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer this new wave of metal bands stood in direct contrast with the pop-oriented metal that dominated the charts during the '80s, but they managed to cultivate dedicated cult followings that would eventually allow them to go platinum with no support from mainstream media, radio, or MTV.

Although the scene was much more diverse than that, attention centered mainly on Norwegian black metal and Swedish death metal. Sometimes nicknamed Viking metal, the basic Norwegian sound was noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies. Swedish death metal bands, meanwhile, tended to favor thick, grinding, detuned riffs instead of a blur of white noise. In both cases, though, there was an audibly chilly bleakness permeating most of the music, which critics often likened to Scandinavian winters. After the Scandinavian scene first came to international attention during the early '90s, some bands began to expand upon the basic blueprints, often adding progressive levels of instrumental technique to the music's core intensity. A second wave of Norwegian bands followed, and the Swedish scene came to be dominated by the so-called \"Gothenburg sound,\" which essentially married ultra-heavy but memorable riffs and death-style vocals to more traditional song structures and an audible influence from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Several Finnish acts rose to prominence during the '90s as well; they tended to be even more indebted to the NWOBHM.

With few exceptions, rap-metal is far and away the domain of white musicians coming to the form from the metal side of the equation. Prior to the initial emergence of rap-metal, there had been several successful fusions of rap with hard rock guitar -- Run-D.M.C.'s collaboration with Aerosmith on a remake of the latter's \"Walk This Way,\" the Beastie Boys' Licensed to Ill -- but the true birth of rap-metal was Anthrax's comic 1987 single \"I'm the Man,\" which combined a heavy guitar riff (actually the melody of \"Hava Nagila\") with full-fledged, surprisingly competent rapping. Funk-metal outfits like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More dabbled in the style, but the intense hardcore tone commonly associated with '90s rap-metal was established by another Anthrax record, a 1991 remake of Public Enemy's \"Bring the Noise\" that featured members of PE itself. Some metal bands had come to associate hardcore rap with the street-tough urban attitude they wanted to project, and after \"Bring the Noise,\" they suddenly found it possible to experiment with fusing the two. Many of these efforts focused not on the linguistic and rhythmic complexity of rap, but on the cathartic intensity that could be achieved by sort of shout-rapping the lyrics instead of singing them. In spite of projects like 1993's much-hyped Judgment Night soundtrack -- which featured all-star teamings of artists from the rap and rock worlds -- crossover collaborations faded as the '90s wore on. At the same time, rap-metal began to draw influences from alternative metal -- specifically, bands like Helmet, White Zombie, and Tool, who relied on crushingly heavy sonic textures more than catchy songwriting or immediately memorable riffs. The thick sound and the lack of melodic emphasis fit rap-metal's concerns perfectly. With the exception of Rage Against the Machine's angry left-wing politics, most rap-metal bands during the mid- to late '90s blended an ultra-aggressive, testosterone-heavy theatricality with either juvenile humor or an introspective angst learned through alternative metal; the vocalists drew from hip-hop MC traditions in varying degrees. Some alt-metal bands, spearheaded by Korn, incorporated hip-hop beats into their music, but full-fledged rap-metal always featured a rapper as frontman. Limp Bizkit became rap-metal's most popular band during the late '90s.            "}

Punk metal bands generally had more technique than the average hardcore outfit, but their riffs weren't quite as intricate as the average thrashers, and their song structures were often more straightforward. Especially early on, punk metal had a strong affinity with skatepunk, but gradually became more and more the province of metal audiences. As the '90s dawned, many remaining punk metal outfits had begun moving into the territory that became known as alternative metal; Corrosion of Conformity, for example, played a stripped-down, grungy take on the classic Black Sabbath sound, while Suicidal Tendencies experimented with alternative rock and funk metal.

Progressive metal first surfaced in the late '80s, led by such bands as the Pink Floydian Queensryche. At the time, prog-metal was fairly underground (although such Metallica albums as And Justice for All were as dense and layered as prog albums), and it remained that way throughout the '90s. However, it was popular enough to produce a handful of crossover hits, most notably Queensryche's \"Silent Lucidity.\" But even though it never became a huge seller in the '90s, progressive metal always had a dedicated following, and bands like Queensryche and Dream Theater stayed on major labels throughout the decade.

Though it sometimes incorporated the complexity of progressive metal, or the menace and growling vocals of death metal, power metal was essentially a classicist style, paying unabashed tribute to its influences. Its tight sense of groove was rooted in the NWOBHM and early-'80s Teutonic outfits like Accept; it also drew from the flashy technical chops and pseudo-operatic vocals of NWOBHM mainstays Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.

Some pop-metal bands emphasized metal's most important building block -- the guitar riff -- more than others, but pop-metal's main attraction were the huge, catchy hooks that owed a great deal to the fist-pumping choruses of arena rock. Most of the Los Angeles-based bands (where the scene was heavily concentrated) also drew on the elaborate visual stylings of British glam rock, which resulted in the much-maligned \"hair metal\" boom of the late '80s. While pop-metal sounded loud and aggressive on the surface, it nearly always had a slick studio sheen that kept it radio-friendly. '70s artists like Aerosmith and Alice Cooper had an undeniable influence on pop-metal, but the band that sparked the true genesis of the style was Kiss.  Kiss' music was catchy and utterly simple, and their wildly theatrical visuals were an essential part of their appeal. Next came Van Halen, whose wild party-rock and virtuoso lead guitarist set the style for much of the pop-metal that followed. The first wave of pop-metal -- bands like Motley Crue (who would later become superstars), Quiet Riot, Dokken, Ratt, and Twisted Sister -- wasn't quite as poppy as it would later become, save for Def Leppard's 1983 landmark Pyromania, perhaps the most melodic metal album up to that point. Bon Jovi's 1986 smash Slippery When Wet ushered in the age of hair metal, where photogenic looks (and, yes, teased-up hair) became just as important in selling a band as the music itself. The following year, Def Leppard's Hysteria set new standards for smoothed-out production as well as blockbuster sales. Not all subsequent pop-metal fell into the slick, image-conscious hair-metal camp; Guns N' Roses, Tesla, and Skid Row often had a grittier edge, and Extreme was unpredictably eclectic, while veteran rockers Kiss, Aerosmith, and Alice Cooper all staged pop-friendly comebacks. But by and large, the hair bands reigned supreme, playing lots of sleazy Aerosmith boogie and big AOR-style power ballads with bits of Van Halen flash; Poison embodied the glammed-up, party-hearty excess of hair metal perhaps better than any. Pop-metal and hair metal (and the excess and formula that had come to be associated with both) were effectively wiped off the musical map by grunge in 1991; some pop-metal bands continued to record for smaller labels and cult audiences, but the music's reputation had suffered too much to restore its former glamour.

Zohar was written between the second and 13th centuries as a commentary on the Pentateuch. Ideas expressed in the music of the Chassidic Jews include, but are not limited to, angelic harmonies, secret melodies, a disregard for art music, devotion to God, direct communication and access to God, and inspired melodies and rhythms as music is spontaneously sung while participants revel in a state of ecstasy. Characteristically, the musical expressions fill the spectrum of melodic and rhythmic ambiance from the meditative to the explosive.             "}

Kabuki can then be understood as an aesthetic theatrical movement within the context of Japan's unification. Accordingly it still holds an honored position in Japanese cultural events. During the course of a Kabuki production, four \"acts\" take place: the deha, chuha, odoriji, and the iriha. In the deha, the setting is depicted and the characters are introduced. During the chuha, the story unfolds, characterized by lyricism, to a dramatic point. The third part of the Kabuki is the major dance of the play, which is followed by the fourth part, or the finale. During the course of a Kabuki production, musicians are located both on and off the stage. Musicians on the Kabuki stage provide musical elaborations on the story and also accompany the dances. The musicians who are off stage during a Kabuki performance set the mood, convey aspects of characters' inner thoughts, and provide sound effects for the production.             "}

The crowning musical achievement of the Javanese is in bronze: the great bronze gamelan orchestra of central Java, which in its complete modern form comprises 70 to 80 instruments. With it are solo vocalists (pasindhen) and a choir (gerongan) of up to 15 members. A complete gamelan consists of two almost identical sets of instruments with some gongs and drums common to both sets; one set is tuned to the five toned slendro tonality and one is tuned to the seven-toned pelog. No two orchestras are tuned exactly alike. Mythologically, the most revered instrument of the gamelan is the great gong (gong ageng) where, it is said, the great spirit of the orchestra resides.The music of Bali is also dominated by ensembles of gongs (called gamelan in Indonesian). Ensembles often include a few stringed instruments, bamboo flutes, and/or vocalists. Bali supports a slightly different type of gamelan gong-chime orchestra music than that of Java. Melodic elaboration in Bali is often achieved through the use of fast, interlocking patterns. The pairs of instruments that play the interlocking parts are tuned slightly off from each other, to create a shimmering sound. Gamelan clubs are common in Bali; these clubs have recast old palace instruments to make new gong sets. One such gamelan is the gong kebyar, which uses both old and new instruments.The orchestral compositions that make up the gamelan repertoire are highly stratified, sometimes consisting of as many as 25 distinct layers of complex, mathematically structured, simultaneous variations on a given melodic skeleton called the balungan. Balinese gamelan music is based on the precise articulation of extremely fast, interlocking parts. There is very little improvisation in Balinese gamelan music.            "}

Bhangra developed as a dance music performed during the festival of bisakh, celebrating the end of the harvesting season; the music took its name as an extension of the word \"bhang,\" or hemp -- the crop most commonly harvested. Originally accompanied only by the loping rhythms of the dhol, a large barrel drum, bhangra quickly grew in popularity throughout the Punjabi community, making its way into more urbanized areas. Over time, the dhol was usurped by the dholak, a popular double-headed drum tapered at both ends. A common repertoire was eventually established -- the songs were informed by a lighthearted spirit, and their lyrical themes were dominated by ideas of love and romance. For decades bhangra was exclusively the province of the Punjabis, but by the late '70s it had emerged as the music of choice of second- and third-generation British Asians as well.            "}

The existence of sound sculpture goes back to the early ages of civilization, one of the first examples being aeolian harps, such as the aeolian organ of the Guadalcanal, a seaside construction of bamboo with slits cut in for the wind to play.Some sculptures are devised to be \"played\" by its environment (air, water, earth vibrations, etc.) -- additionally, their sound can be treated electronically, as with Mnortham's aeolian constructions or [The User]'s 2000-2001 Silophone project. Other sculptures are meant to be played by a musician by bowing, plucking or striking parts of its structure. These are similar to home-built instruments, although they are usually conceived following a more visual than practical point of view. Sculptors in this field include Chas Smith, Tom Nunn, Peter Warren, and Paul Panhuysen. Finally, some sculptures are self-playing automatons (Dan Senn, Maxime Rioux, Frank Pahl).

Commissions for works from public organizations, especially in the fields of contemporary music, electroacoustic music, and sound art, have often been the occasion for composers to take even greater chances and experiment with new forms of expression.The role of public radio in all Western countries has been crucial to the development of avant-garde music, but West-German radio stands apart. Very early in the development of radio transmission, a form of art specific to the medium appeared, the h\u00f6rspiel, or \"radio play.\" An extension of the radio drama, the h\u00f6rspiel pairs a narrative with music, but its existence is specific to the airwaves -- it could not be performed on stage, since there is no visual elements and it is conceived so that speech and music are integrated into a multimedia work of art. Starting in the 1950s, German composers like Klaus Schoning and Franz Mon developed the new radio play, often called klangspiel, \"sound play\" (although the term h\u00f6rspiel remains the most commonly used, even outside of the Germanic sphere). Their works put speech (either in the form of a narrative or of a phonetic deconstruction) at the center, while including music, musique concr\u00e8te, and collage techniques. Many members of the avant-garde, from John Cage to Pierre Henry, took the plunge and started to devise radio-specific works fitted to a certain duration (usually 30 or 60 minutes). Public radios around the world, but especially in France, England, and Canada, regularly commission programs from a wide range of avant-garde artists that encompass electroacoustic composers and avant-rock figures (Chris Cutler, Heiner Goebbels). Since the 1980s, the group Negativland specializes in live radio performance, inviting the audience to interact through call-in segments. The rise of the compact disc allowed works to be released on record (with its surface noise and time limits, the LP was unsuitable).             "}

Post-minimalism began circa 1980 and built upon the foundation laid down by minimalism's first practitioners. The new post-minimalist composers and performers were arguably open to even more influences than their forebears -- including rock, jazz, world music, folk, sound art, noise, and even the occasional classical Romantic gesture. Of course, minimalists Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, and LaMonte Young were greatly influenced by non-Western musical traditions, but the post-minimalists would go further to loosen -- or, some might say, water down -- minimalism's formal strictures.Music writer and composer Kyle Gann cites several major composers in a first wave of post-minimalism as the '70s ended and the '80s began -- William Duckworth, Janice Giteck, Daniel Lentz, Ingram Marshall, and Jonathan Kramer -- and Gann also mentions the influences they drew from as they moved beyond minimalism, ranging from Messiaen to Balinese music to U.S. patriotic tunes. On the rock side of the equation, Gann includes leaders on the cutting edge of the New York no wave scene such as Glenn Branca and Rhys Chatham in his description of post-minimalism. Others who may be familiar to avant jazz and rock audiences include Mikal Rouse, David Borden, and Guy Klucevsek. Composer John Adams was initially viewed as a minimalist but went on to meld the rhythmic propulsion of minimalism with Romantic elements and Stravinsky-informed neo-classicism. Composers associated with the New York-based Bang on a Can -- notably David Lang, Julia Wolf, Michael Gordon, and Evan Ziporyn -- also remain enamored of minimalist approaches yet clearly feel free to explore a host of other contemporary music influences from world music to electronica.On the other side of the Atlantic, Dutch composer Louis Andriessen is seen as a major figure in European minimalism, while also establishing a reputation in the post-minimalist world. Andriessen, who has described his music as \"avant-garde minimal music that also dealt with jazz from the twenties,\" has worked closely with the British new music ensemble Icebreaker, a group that often moves in post-minimalist directions. Sicilian cellist Giovanni Sollima has also been labeled as a post-minimalist, using repeating arpeggios and ostinati while incorporating rock and jazz influences as well as Mediterranean folk forms. Continuing the post-minimalist thread, Sollima has collaborated with the French/Belgian ensemble Art Zoyd, whose earliest semi-acoustic incarnation might be considered an influence on the Flemish drummerless avant-prog chamber group Aranis, a 21st century band that brings post-minimalist flexibility to music with occasional strong Philip Glass-like tendencies.

Through the creation of abstract sound mosaics divorced from conventional musical theory, he pioneered a sonic revolution which continues to resonate across the contemporary cultural landscape, most deeply in the grooves of hip-hop and electronica. Born in 1910, Schaeffer was not a trained musician or composer, but was instead working as a radio engineer when he founded the RTF electronic studio in 1944 to begin his first experiments in what would ultimately be dubbed musique concr\u00e8te. Working with found fragments of sound -- both musical and environmental in origin -- he assembled his first tape-machine pieces, collages of noise manipulated through changes in pitch, duration, and amplitude; the end result heralded a radical new interpretation of musical form and perception.In October 1948, Schaeffer broadcast his first public piece, \"Etude aux Chemins de Fer,\" over French radio airwaves; although the public reaction ranged from comic disbelief to genuine outrage, many composers and performers were intrigued, among them Pierre Henry, who in 1949 joined the RTF staff, as well as future collaborators Luc Ferrari and Iannis Xenakis. (Olivier Messiaen was also a guest, bringing with him students Karlheinz Stockhausen and Pierre Boulez.) Schaeffer forged on, in 1948 completing \"Etude Pathetique,\" which in its frenetic mix of sampled voices anticipated the emergence of hip-hop scratching techniques by over a generation; by 1949's \"Suite pour 14 Instruments,\" he had turned to neo-classical textures, distorted virtually beyond recognition. In 1950, Schaeffer and Henry collaborated on \"Symphonie pour un homme seul,\" a 12-movement work employing the sounds of the human body.Working with the classically trained Henry on subsequent pieces, including \"Variations Sur une Flute Mexicaine\" and \"Orphee 51,\" clearly informed Schaeffer's later projects, as he soon adopted a more accessible musical approach. Together, the two men also co-founded the Groupe de Musique Concr\u00e8te in 1951; later rechristened the Groupe de Recherches Musicales, or GRM, their studio became the launching pad behind some of the most crucial electronic music compositions of the era, among them Edgard Var\u00e8se's \"Deserts.\" However, by the end of the decade most of the GRM's members grew increasingly disenchanted with the painstaking efforts required to construct pieces from vinyl records and magnetic tape; after later, tightly constructed works like 1958's \"Etude aux Sons Animes\" and the next year's \"Etudes aux Objets,\" even Schaeffer himself announced his retirement from music in 1960.Leaving the GRM in the hands of Francois Bayle, some months later Schaeffer founded the research center of the Office of French Television Broadcasting, serving as its director from 1960 to 1975; in 1967, he also published an essay titled \"Musique Concr\u00e8te: What Do I Know?\" which largely dismissed the principles behind his groundbreaking work, concluding that what music now needed was \"searchers,\" not \"auteurs.\" In later years, Schaeffer did explore areas of psycho-acoustic research which he dubbed Traite de Objets Musicaux (TOM); these experiments yielded one final piece, the 11-minute \"Le Triedre Fertile.\" He also hit the lecture circuit and agreed to produce radio presentations. Pierre Schaeffer died in Aix-en-Provence on August 19, 1995.             "}

This meta-art or anti-art originates from French artist Marcel Duchamp whose 1910s ready-mades tried to expose the inner workings of institutionalized art. His \"Fountain\" (1917) was actually a real urinal on which he put his signature. His \"Mona Lisa\" (1919) added a mustache, a beard, and an obscene riddle to the famous portrait. The removal of the sacred aura surrounding art influenced every form of expression, especially during the 1960s and after. In music, John Cage was one of the first to experiment with conceptual art with his 1954 work \"4:33\" -- four minutes thirty-three seconds of silence (even more conceptual was the act of releasing the piece on a record). Basically, any work in which the process of creation or the intention motivating the artist is obviously more important (to the artist and the listener) than the results it created belongs to conceptual art.One good example is DJ Christian Marclay's Record Without Grooves (Ecart Editions, 1987), a virgin LP. The same artist also released Footsteps (Rec Rec, 1990), a one-sided LP of recorded footsteps. After being pressed, the 1000 copies were scattered on the floor of an art gallery and visitors were invited to step on them. When the LP is played, the dirt and scratches blend in with the recorded material. Such albums are usually released in very limited quantities and collected and preserved as works of art. Not all conceptual artists work with the medium itself (be it LP or CD). Some play on the definition of music. Other approaches in conceptual art include (but are by no means limited to) Christof Migone's extremely minutious studies of a very short sample (to the point of leaving only silence), Jliat's replacement of music by series of raw data, and Koji Asano's long sound art pieces packaged with as little information as possible in order to render the reality of his work more blurry.

Some improvisers prefer to use structured improvisation to give a backbone to the music or simply to vary the context of performance. Structured improvisations are often credited to a \"composer,\" i.e. the musician who devised the piece. It may have a score, but no notes (or very few) are specified. Abstract graphics are drawn or sets of rules regarding range, timbre, speed, etc. are outlined. Sometime the \"composition\" part can be limited to directives concerning the order of appearance, for example: the alto saxophone will start the piece, then there will be three sets of duets and everyone will join in for the last part. In other circumstances, the rules can be quite complex and take the form of an interactive game. An improvisation can also be structured instantly by a conductor who, through the use of body gestures (even dance, in the case of Masashi Harada) or showing of cards, will give more or less clearly defined signals to the improvisers. Such conduction (a term coined by Lawrence \"Butch\" Morris for conducting an improvisation) is often used by creative orchestras, ensembles in which the number of free improvising musicians is too big to make listening to everyone possible. A central \"listener\" is then designated to lead the group. Artists like John Zorn (his game pieces, mostly) and Anthony Braxton, and ensembles like the London Improvisers Orchestra regularly perform structured improvisations.             "}

To improvise means to perform without preparation, to make music on the spot. Improvising is nothing new: classical composers like Mozart were accomplished improvisers. But free improvisation lets the musician do whatever he wants, regardless of any rule. Rhythm, harmony, melody, even respect for the physical integrity of the instrument itself (preparations and home-built instruments are often used) are shattered. The free improviser channels his creative energy through his instrument and plays. A lot harder than it may seem, free improvising requires extensive musical and psychological training, as the musician must attain a high level of concentration, an ability to metaphorically strip naked in front of the audience, and if he is not performing alone, to listen to the other improvisers in order to interact with them if he doesn\u00b9t want to get isolated. Free improvisers come from very diverse backgrounds -- jazz (Cecil Taylor, Derek Bailey), rock (Thurston Moore), electronica (Fennesz, Jim O'Rourke, Voice Crack), even classical (Patrick Scheyer, Aki Takase) -- and perform in settings ranging from solo to large groups called creative orchestras.Free improvisation is not the same as free jazz, although some key musicians like Bailey and Taylor came from such a background. Free jazz often remained anchored in its originating idiom, using heads and licks to structure the improvised material. There is no such thing in free improvisation -- being freed of all rules, it cannot be traced back to a genre other than the very generic term \"avant-garde.\" As a style, free improv started to emerge in the late 1960s, mainly on the Berlin and London scenes, when people like Peter Br\u00f6tzmann and the musicians revolving around (and trained by) John Stevens started to push American free jazz into more abstract territories. Br\u00f6tzmann\u00b9s 1968 LP Machine Gun shattered the world of free jazz and pioneered a form of improv characterized by extreme energy levels. Around Stevens and his Spontaneous Music Ensemble, a group of musicians developed an approach to improvisation relying on listening, toning down, trying to \"become\" the other musicians while being oneself, instead of attempting to outplay the other participants. This school of free improv is best exemplified by the productions released on the record label Emanem. In the late 1990s/early 2000s, an even more radical approach to free improvisation emerged, based on silence and the use of very short, very fragmented musical gestures. People like John Butcher, Axel D\u00f6rner, Franz Hautzinger and Radu Malfatti first explored these extremes.            "}

To successfully improvise as a large group implies many difficulties -- mainly, it multiplies the risks inherent to listening and concentration by the number of participants, may it be 10, 50 or 100. Creative orchestras first developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s as pools of free improvisers and laboratories to try new ideas. John Stevens' Spontaneous Music Orchestra, for instance, had an ever-changing line-up which consisted of the participants to his workshops. Such ensembles had short lifespans and rarely recorded, mostly because the technology did not allow practical solutions for recording such large groups when they were not backed financially by a major record company -- one notable exception being Keith Tippett's one hundred-piece project Centipede. During the 1980s, a few orchestras were established with a more permanent line-up, like the Walter Thompson Orchestra and the Vancouver-based NOW Orchestra, which became a favorite vehicle for composers who wanted to investigate the border between composed and improvised music (the NOW Orchestra has recorded works by people as diverse as George Lewis and Ren\u00e9 Lussier). As the outlets for avant-garde music increased in the late 1990s, with more clubs, festivals and independent record labels dedicated to this kind of music, creative orchestras became more numerous, the best new specimens being the London Improvisers Orchestra and the Micro-East Collective.

However, even though the frame of reference is larger, the key elements of parody -- mimicry and comic recontextualization -- are still present, and a full understanding of the humor still depends upon recognition of the source material. Since humorous exaggeration is so important to this style of parody, it's the one that most frequently crosses the line into satire -- i.e., making specific, pointed commentary on the performers, fans, aesthetics, or other qualities associated with the original works. Whatever their scope or ambition, though, song parodies have long been the most popular type of musical humor, simply because anyone can at least try their hand at the form.            "}

Nevertheless, the very squareness of the genre is what makes it appealing. Country comedy grew directly out of vaudeville and burlesque, where comedians told silly jokes. Initially, country performers -- including the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers -- would perform comedy skits during their shows, and comedians like Minnie Pearl were major figures at the Grand Ole Opry. Often, country comedians were simply comedians, but there were several -- like Grandpa Jones and Homer & Jethro -- that were excellent musicians as well. From the late '40s to the mid-'60s, artists like Homer & Jethro were popular both as comedians and musicians, but by the beginning of the '70s, country comedy became the provinces of comedians. Of course, there were still novelty singles, but country comedy was largely relegated to live performances, not records. In the mid-'90s, Jeff Foxworthy renewed country comedy as a viable commercial proposition with his series of You Might Be a Redneck If... records.

Only one performer rose to fame directly through the Detroit blues scene: John Lee Hooker, whose idiosyncratic style was difficult to imitate and thus never became the standard sound of the city.

Like Chicago, the Detroit blues scene hit its creative prime in the late '40s and early '50s, centered around the clubs on Hastings Street and the surrounding Black Bottom neighborhood. Pianist Big Maceo Merriweather went on to greater fame on the Chicago scene, but for the most part, Detroit's finest performers -- including singer Alberta Adams and guitarists/singers Calvin Frazier, Eddie Burns, and Johnnie Bassett -- gained little recognition outside of their hometown, due in part to a relative lack of promotion and recording opportunities.

During the early days of recorded blues, raunchy songs were recorded nearly as often as love songs and laments. These songs were distinguished by their often humorous double entendres and metaphors; in performance, the songs could actually flirt with the vulgar, but on wax, the meanings were suggested. The dirty blues primarily were about sex, but there were many songs about drugs and reefer that were essentially dirty blues -- namely, simple country blues with taboo lyrics. The dirty blues thrived in the days before World War II. After the war, many record labels concentrated on records that were commercially viable, and the dirty blues faded away, only to be resurrected during the blues revival of the '60s, when many white collegiates discovered the form.

The era of traditional country didn't begin until the late '20s, when Jimmie Rodgers became the first national country music star. Rodgers brought the formerly rural music into the industrial era by streamlining the music and lyrics; in the process, he made the genre a viable commercial property. Following Rodgers' success, old-time music faded in popularity and traditional country was born. For the next 40 years, most country music fell under the traditional country umbrella, regardless if it was the big-band dance music of Western swing or driving roadhouse honky tonk. The majority of the popular artists from the '30s and '40s -- Acuff, Eddy Arnold, Ernest Tubb, Hank Williams -- became the foundation of the Grand Ole Opry, a weekly radio broadcast that became the definitive word of country music. This generation of musicians inspired all the artists that emerged in the following two decades, who put their own spin on traditional country. Following the emergence of rock & roll, country music began to incorporate more pop production techniques, and although this Nashville sound was smoother than the music of the '40s and early '50s, it still conformed to the conventions of traditional country. During the '60s, mainstream country became progressively more pop-influenced, yet traditional country held strong until the early '70s, when country-pop became the dominant form of country music. Many fans of hard country turned toward the tougher sounds of progressive country and outlaw country, yet most of the country audience continued to listen to country-pop, especially since traditional country singers like George Jones, Conway Twitty, and Loretta Lynn had turned toward that subgenre. By the late '70s, most new country singers were either raised on country-pop or pop/rock, and consequently, the reign of traditional country came to an end. During the mid-'80s, a wave of new-traditionalist singers such as George Strait emerged, but their music tended to be influenced by contemporaries as well, making the movement as much an evolution as a revival.

The most common were the washboard (whose slats were struck and rubbed in a way analogous to a snare drum) and the metal washtub bass, which was usually equipped with a broomstick and clothesline that produced the sounds. Other possible percussion instruments included spoons, gut buckets, bones, and saw blades; additional melodic accompaniment might have included a harmonica, kazoo, or even comb and tissue paper -- whatever was available and economical, really. Jug band music originated in Louisville, Kentucky at the dawn of the 1900s, but found its greatest popularity in Memphis, Tennessee during the '10s and '20s, eventually spreading to Ohio and North Carolina as well. Given the inherent playfulness of the instrumentation, jug band music was accordingly informal, spontaneous, often humorous, and rhythmically bouncy. The most important bands included the Memphis Jug Band, Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers, and Earl McDonald's Dixieland Jug Blowers. The regional jug band fad had largely passed by the '30s, but the British skiffle movement of the '50s and America's own early-'60s folk revival brought a renewed appreciation of the style. Good-humored preservationist outfits like the Jim Kweskin Jug Band and the Even Dozen Jug Band sprang up Stateside; additionally, members of both the Grateful Dead and the Lovin' Spoonful got their start playing jug band music.

This tradition continued to inform country & western music long after its attendant lifestyle had all but disappeared, since romanticized cowboy mythology still held a fascination for many. That fascination resulted in the production of innumerable Western and cowboy films, and with those films came a revival of interest in cowboy music. Actually, it wasn't so much a revival as a hunger for more mythology -- singer/actors like Roy Rogers and Gene Autry relied far more on new compositions which evoked similar themes of cowboy life. The performances and production of cowboy songs depend largely on the context -- while movie songs were usually recorded with modern soundtrack-style orchestras, old-time groups like the Sons of the Pioneers relied on traditional, unadorned acoustic instruments. While it's the spirit of cowboy music, rather than specific standard songs, that has generally survived in country music, some artists have sought to preserve the tradition and educate their audiences about authentic cowboy songs; Michael Martin Murphey became a notable figure in these efforts during the '90s.

A certain segment of country musicians continued playing traditional string music. Led by Bill Monroe, these musicians adhered to the songs, structures, and conventions of string bands, but they made the music faster, harder, and more technically demanding. The result was bluegrass; the genre was named after Bill Monroe's backing band, the Blue Grass Boys. After its inception in the mid-'40s, and its popularization in the '50s, the sound had become part of country music, and there were legions of bands that followed in their footsteps. In the late '60s, a number of bluegrass groups began expanding the possibilities of the genre, much to the chagrin of many of the music's most popular artists and dedicated fans. Consequently, the new breed of bluegrass groups were dubbed progressive bluegrass, while those that adhered to the music's heritage were tagged traditional bluegrass.

Progressive country was rootsier and more intellectual than many of its contemporary genres; it was more concerned with breaking boundaries than with scoring hits. The genre was also songwriter-based. Many of its key artists -- Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Billy Joe Shaver, Tom T. Hall, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Butch Hancock -- were not \"good\" singers by conventional standards, yet they wrote distinctive, individual songs and had compelling voices. By the early '70s, such artists had developed a sizable cult following, and progressive country began to inch its way into the mainstream, usually in the form of cover versions (Sammi Smith took Kristofferson's \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\" to the country Top Ten). Progressive country also provided the basis for outlaw country, a harder-edged genre that shook country-pop (briefly) off the top of the charts in the mid-'70s.

During that decade, many of the most popular hardcore country singers of the '60s -- from George Jones to Merle Haggard -- softened their sound slightly, moving away from their honky tonk roots. While the outlaws weren't strictly honky tonk -- they were as much storytellers in the tradition of folk songwriters as they were honky tonk vocalists -- they kept that spirit alive. Outlaws didn't play by Nashville's rules. They didn't change their music to fit the heavily produced, pop-oriented Nashville sound, nor did they go out of their way to fit into the accepted conventions of country music. Instead, they created an edgy form of hardcore country that was influenced by rock & roll, folk, and blues. Ironically, two of the leading figures of the movement -- Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson -- had their roots in the music industry, but by the time they came into their own as recording artists in the mid-'70s, they had developed a unique, defiant way of performing. Several other musicians -- including David Allan Coe, Billy Joe Shaver, and Tompall Glaser -- followed in their footsteps, and the outlaws were quite popular for a period of three to four years. At the end of the '70s, the urban cowboy movement easily eclipsed the outlaw movement in terms of commercial appeal, but the outlaws had a lasting influence. During the '80s, certain neo-traditionalists owed a bit of their sound to the outlaws, while a whole breed of songwriters, led by Steve Earle, demonstrated a massive debt to the outlaws and their fusion of country, folk, and rock.

Moreover, country-folk performers tend to find greater appreciation among folk audiences; among country fans, it's often just their songwriting skill that finds acceptance, and that only when full-fledged country singers cover their compositions. There are exceptions on both sides of the fence, of course, but the overall trend is probably due to the fact that country-folk has a mellower, gentler feel than most country, whose audience has usually been weaned on performances that are rowdier or more sentimental. Country-folk artists who compose their own material usually concentrate a great deal on crafting thoughtful, often emotionally complex lyrics, thus keeping with the singer/songwriter tradition established by folk-rock artists like Bob Dylan.

It's become an enduring staple, the style to which mainstream country inevitably returns time and time again to refresh itself, a source of inspiration and renewal when popular trends begin to take country music away from its roots. The basic honky tonk sound features acoustic and/or electric guitar, fiddle, string bass, and steel guitar (which was imported from Hawaiian music), while the vocals often draw from the so-called \"high lonesome\" sound of traditional country, sounding either rough and nasal (Hank Williams, Ernest Tubb) or smooth and clear (Lefty Frizzell, George Jones). Like the music, honky tonk lyrics are emotionally simple and direct, often with a plain-spoken vulnerability and a sense of emotional release. Instead of depicting rural life, though, honky tonk's subject matter was rooted in its immediate surroudings -- taverns. Celebrations of romance, parties, and good times were quite common (as were novelty songs), but honky tonk became especially well-known for its fascination with the flip side: heartbreak, infidelity, pain that could only be numbed with alcohol, morning-after remorse, and religious guilt. Although it's generally thought of as a rural music, honky tonk was actually more the result of rural migration to Southern urban centers, particularly those of Texas. The music initially became popular during World War II, with Ernest Tubb becoming its first star; however, the '50s proved to be honky tonk's golden age. Singer and songwriter Hank Williams hit his absolute prime at the dawn of the decade, and Lefty Frizzell forever altered the way country music was sung with his smooth, lengthy melodic phrases and rich, pure tenor. George Jones rose to prominence in the middle of the decade, becoming a near-consensus choice for country's greatest-ever interpretive singer by adding a startling emotional intensity to Frizzell's phrasing innovations. Honky tonk slowly declined in popularity as rockabilly and country-pop captured mainstream audiences, but its signature sound informed virtually every reaction against country-pop in the decades to come: Bakersfield country in the '60s, progressive and outlaw country in the '70s, and New Traditionalist country in the '80s and '90s.

Atkins designed a smooth, commercial sound that relied on country song structures but abandoned all of the hillbilly and honky tonk instrumentation. He hired session musicians and coordinated pop-oriented, jazz-tinged productions. Similarly, Owen Bradley created productions -- most notably with Patsy Cline -- that featured sophisticated productions and smooth, textured instrumentation. Eventually, most records from Nashville featured this style of production and the Nashville sound began to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. In the late '60s, the Nashville sound metamorphosed into countrypolitan, which emphasized these kinds of pop production flourishes. Featuring layers of keyboards, guitars, strings, and vocals, countrypolitan records were designed to cross over to pop radio and they frequently did.

When rockabilly took off, however, country musicians were forced to consider whether their true affinities lay with traditional country or with this popular new style, which allowed artists to reach crossover audiences for the first time. This flirtation with the mainstream marked the beginnings of country-pop, which grew out of the realization that country-influenced music (as opposed to straight-ahead honky tonk) could be hybridized and smoothed out for mass consumption. RCA Records producer Chet Atkins was the most important figure in the initial cross-breeding of country and pop, creating a sound that was dubbed \"countrypolitan\" for its blend of rural sensibility and urban sophistication. Because the melodies and song structures of country music were usually very simple and catchy, they worked well when placed in a pop-oriented format; Atkins' productions often placed the songs in orchestral arrangements heavy on the strings, which sometimes blended with country instrumentation and sometimes stood alone. This approach resulted in a bevy of pop crossover hits for singers who could make the transition to Atkins' smooth, polished style, most notably Jim Reeves. Decca Records producer Owen Bradley crafted an even lusher sound for his artists, most importantly providing the sympathetic sonic environment that best showcased the angelic voice of Patsy Cline, and making her a star in the process. Countrypolitan pop eventually came to be tagged \"the Nashville Sound,\" since nearly all of its records were produced there. But even as its practitioners racked up hit after hit, the first of many backlashes against country-pop began to form in the 1960s among artists frustrated at not fitting into the Nashville mold; the biggest came in the form of the Bakersfield sound, with its hard-driving beat, electric instrumentation, and love of old-style honky tonk. Nevertheless, the Nashville sound continued to prosper among fans of mainstream-oriented country. In fact, it became more popular than ever during the '70s thanks to producer Billy Sherrill, whose orchestrations and recordings were even more grandiose and detailed, and owed as much to \"Wall of Sound\" rock producer Phil Spector as they did to Atkins and Bradley; George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Charlie Rich, and Conway Twitty all benefited immensely from his touch. A simpler country-pop sound, which more closely resembled pop/rock with country trappings, also made inroads on non-country radio during the decade, thanks in part to country-rock fusion efforts by Bob Dylan, the Byrds, and the Flying Burrito Brothers; this sound was spearheaded by artists like Glen Campbell, John Denver and B.J. Thomas. The mid-'70s saw another rebellion in the edgier, more eclectic form of outlaw country, but by the end of the decade, the film Urban Cowboy had popularized a new variation on country-pop (named after the film), which smoothed the music out even more by blending it with soft-rock influences. During the mid- to late '80s, the new traditionalist movement sought to return country to its honky tonk roots, but its polished (yet not elaborate) production helped lay the groundwork for a new breed of country-pop that was informed by rock & roll, both in its driving beat and its big-sounding production techniques. This sound made Garth Brooks a superstar during the '90s and brought pop crossover success to Billy Ray Cyrus; toward the end of the decade, the emphasis had shifted to female vocalists like Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes, and Faith Hill, whose brands of country-pop could encompass soft-rock covers, roots-rock, or arena-rock-style production.

While their sound drew primarily on classic honky tonk, it also boasted all the advantages of updated production techniques and equipment, proving that pure country music could sound authentic yet modern. At its outset, Contemporary Country built upon this revelation, taking the foundation laid by new traditionalist country and infusing it with pop/rock sensibilities -- without sounding wimpy. During the late '80s and early '90s, contemporary country was still essentially country at its core, even though it was reaching a wider audience than ever, thanks in no small part to Garth Brooks and his latent rock influences. Although pop-crossover hit singles were still a rare occurrence at this point, contemporary country albums began to sell in unprecedented numbers in the wake of Brooks' success, and while contemporary country was by no means restricted to male singers, they -- with a few notable exceptions -- were the main early beneficiaries of the music's greater visibility. This wave of male artists dominated the early to mid-'90s, mixing country grit and simple, line-dance-ready songcraft in varying proportions, with the new traditionalist movement continuing to hold a strong influence over many; some of the less substantive in the bunch were dubbed \"hat acts,\" after what cynics described as their most appealing attribute. All of the increased exposure eventually pulled contemporary country farther and farther into mainstream pop music, and a number of (mostly) female artists began to actively pursue crossover success; in the most pronounced cases, their music differentiated itself from full-fledged pop/rock only by a certain twang in the vocals. While shifting contemporary country away from its roots, this willingness to play to an even wider audience resulted in massive, genre-dominating popularity for acts like Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes, the Dixie Chicks, and Faith Hill in the late '90s. Whether the songs were closer to neo-honky tonk or pop/rock, though, contemporary country was always marked by its shiny, radio-ready production, which occasionally incorporated synthesizers, but above all kept the music smooth and polished, helping make it more accessible to country, rock, and pop fans alike.

Like Hendrix, his style was so fresh and so revolutionary that many ambitions axe-slingers strived to copy it. Throughout the early '80s, his fluid, speedy hammer-ons and impeccable phrasing could be heard on metal, rock, and pop recordings of all stripes. Soon, there was a whole subgenre of metal containing nothing but guitar virtuosos, or \"shredders.\" Within these shredders, there was a subset of guitarists who were equally influenced by classical music and Van Halen's guitar style. They applied hammers and sweep-picking to classical pieces, using them as vehicles for their prodigious technical abilities. Yngwie Malmsteen was the head of these Neo-Classical Metal guitarists, yet he often worked within the framework of a fairly traditionalist metal band; his records were split between sung songs and instrumental tracks. By the second half of the decade, more and more neo-metal guitarists chose to work in a strictly instrumental vein. This was true of shredders in general -- most notably Joe Satriani and Steve Vai, who broke through to mainstream recognition -- but neo-classical metal guitarists particularly benefited from the sans-singers setting, since it gave them ample room to flex their musical muscles. After all, the primary value of these neo-classical metal guitarists was their technical acumen, and fans and other guitarists alike thrilled to the sounds of extended solos, consisting of blinding arpeggios and flurries of precisely picked notes. Of course, there is a limited audience for this kind of music, and by 1992, when alternative rock had replaced metal in the hearts of many hard rockers, neo-classical metal suffered accordingly. Soon, there weren't as many classical shredders, but a few of the prog-metal bands, such as Dream Theater, carried the flame by incorporating elements of classical and neo-classical metal into their dense music.

Some industrial metal bands base their songs around metal-style guitar riffs, while others use the instrument more for the harsh, abrasive textures it can create. Either way, industrial metal generally possesses greater aggressive force than straight-ahead industrial, which helped the style cross over to metal and alternative audiences accustomed to guitar-driven music. Industrial metal lyrics also mirror the darkness and aggression of standard heavy metal, although the sensibility is filtered through the personal alienation of punk and alternative rock. Whether its rage is turned inward at the self or outward at society, industrial metal is unremittingly bleak and angst-ridden, using its pounding walls of noise as expressions of near-hopeless alienation from the rest of the world. Ministry was the first band to popularize industrial metal in the late '80s, basing their signature grind on countless repetitions of jackhammer guitar riffs, as well as electronics, samples, and distorted vocals; however, it was Nine Inch Nails that really brought the sound to the mainstream during the early '90s, thanks to Trent Reznor's flair for melodic songwriting and multi-layered production. In the wake of NIN's success, a number of similar-sounding bands popped up on alternative radio, and toward the end of the decade, a number of popular alternative metal bands appropriated industrial metal's electronic production touches into their hybrid of aggressive music styles.

Prior to the emergence of goth rock as a post-punk genre, the vaguely medieval, minor-key sounds of metal bands like Rainbow, Dio, and Judas Priest had been described as \"gothic,\" but true goth metal is always directly influenced by goth rock -- ethereal synths and spooky textures are just as important as guitar riffs, if not moreso. Thus, goth metal frequently holds appeal for listeners on both sides of the equation. Goth metal first emerged during the early to mid-'80s, centered around Los Angeles' so-called \"death-rock\" scene headed by Christian Death. Many goth metal bands have since sprung up in both America and Europe, with the tongue-in-cheek Type O Negative breaking out to a wider alternative metal audience in the '90s.

All four players laid the groundwork for the age of the guitar virtuoso, which began in the late '70s with Eddie Van Halen. A fanatical devotee of Clapton, Van Halen relentlessly practiced his instrument, developing a lightning-fast, technically accomplished style that was almost entirely devoid of the blues. There had been a few guitarists immediately before him, including Steve Howe and Allan Holdsworth, that had similar styles, but were less rock-oriented. Eddie Van Halen, however, was a heavy rocker and he immediately spawned legions of imitators -- and these imitators weren't only in metal, but also in mainstream pop. Throughout the '80s, these flashy guitarists dominated mainstream rock and pop, and soon there was an entire subgenre of hard rock that was dedicated to showcase the instrumental acumen of these guitarists. Of course, each metal or hard rock band, from Metallica to Whitesnake, each had a phenomenal guitarist, but soon solo guitar albums became popular. These guitar virtuosos -- often dubbed \"shredders\" by the guitar magazines -- became cult favorites and, in the case of Joe Satriani, they also crossed into the mainstream. By the end of the '80s, the guitar virtuosos had ruled mainstream rock & roll for over a decade, so it wasn't a surprise that they were unseated almost overnight when Nirvana brought primitive punk rock into the Top Ten in 1991. The guitar virtuosos didn't disappear, but they did fade away. They kept recording throughout the '90s, but at a considerably diminished profile.            "}

When it first appeared in the mid-'80s, grindcore in its purest form consisted of short, apocalyptic blasts of noise played on standard heavy metal instrumentation (distorted guitar, bass, drums). Although grindcore wasn't just randomly improvised, it certainly didn't follow conventional structure, either; while riffs could sometimes be picked out, pure grindcore never featured verses, choruses, or even melodies. Grindcore vocals sounded torturous, ranging from high-pitched shrieks to low, throat-shredding growls and barks; although the lyrics were usually quite verbose, they were very rarely intelligible. Grindcore's jaw-dropping aggression was so over the top that pointing to its roots in thrash metal and hardcore punk hardly gives an idea of what it actually sounds like. Indisputably, the band that invented grindcore was Napalm Death, whose 1987 debut album Scum is also perhaps the most representative example of the style. In Napalm Death's hands, grindcore was actually rather arty, a sonic metaphor for the bleakness, violence, and decay of modern society; the group's lyrics were additionally packed with angry social commentary. More extreme in the lyrical department was Carcass, the only other band to really epitomize the original grindcore sound; their gruesome, gory rants were literally taken from anatomical textbooks for maximum shock (and gonzo comedy) factor. However, grindcore's original form was inherently limiting, and its intensity could easily turn into self-parody; on Napalm Death's second album, they had already begun to experiment with industrial textures, a fusion that would prove popular not only with bands who loved the jackhammer rhythms a drum machine could provide, but also with slower, moodier bands like Godflesh (itself a Napalm Death offshoot). Grindcore's blistering intensity was assimilated not only into underground heavy metal, but also into avant-garde and experimental music circles; Japanese noise bands like the Boredoms and Merzbow found it inspiring, and jazz musician John Zorn formed the grindcore-inspired group Painkiller (which featured former Napalm Death drummer Mick Harris). Although pure grindcore was a distinctly British phenomenon, the early albums by the Florida band Death -- which ratcheted up the aggression and morbidity of prime Slayer -- had a raw, crude, assaultive quality that made them extremely similar. Apart from adopting the low, demonic growl of the grindcore vocal style almost wholesale, American death metal bands with relatively limited technical ability who played at fast tempos often resembled grindcore outfits with song structures. In fact, by the '90s, Napalm Death's sound was virtually impossible to separate from either death metal or grindcore, and Carcass had become a full-fledged, even melodic, death metal band. One of the very few bands to stick with grindcore's original form was A.C. (aka Anal Cunt), which primarily employed it to a snottily humorous effect.            "}

Even more indebted to Sabbath than most metal, doom metal is extremely slow, sludgy, and creepy, feeling so heavy it can barely move; its deliberate pace and murky guitars are meant to evoke (what else?) a sense of impending doom. The movement began to take shape in the mid-'80s, as underground bands like the SST label's Saint Vitus, the critically acclaimed Trouble, and Sweden's Candlemass attracted cult audiences for their out-of-fashion, Sabbath-dominated sounds. Trouble and Cathedral helped bring doom metal to a wider (though not mainstream) metal audience during the early '90s, and doom's monolithic darkness quickly made it appealing to a variety of tastes. Doom metal was one of the formative influences on the retro-obsessed stoner metal movement of the '90s, and it was not uncommon for bands to find favor in both camps. Another dominant strain of '90s doom metal -- pioneered by British bands like Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, and Anathema -- fused Sabbath heaviness with the sounds and sensibilities of goth-metal, plus occasional touches of death metal; the results were sorrowful, gloomy epics. The '90s also birthed a unique doom metal scene centered in New Orleans; the sound of bands like Crowbar and Eyehategod was often described as \"sludge metal\" because of their heavy debt to early Seattle grunge bands like the Melvins and Soundgarden. Several doom metal bands incorporated progressive tendencies, though this approach was much less widespread.            "}

Heavy metal was at the core of the music, but the bands were too offbeat and their influences too eclectic to fit into the thrash underground, so their main audiences were mostly alternative fans who liked heavy guitar rock. However, after grunge helped make alternative metal more palatable to mass audiences, it became the most popular style of heavy metal in the '90s, particularly when more aggressive bands began standardizing its sound. That approach was a far cry from alternative metal's early days in the late '80s, when it represented the least categorizable heavy music around. By that time, most surviving hardcore punk bands had moved into metal territory, pushing underground hard-guitar-rock bands to look elsewhere for inspiration. The first wave of alternative metal bands fused heavy metal with prog-rock (Jane's Addiction, Primus), garage punk (Soundgarden, Corrosion of Conformity), noise-rock (the Jesus Lizard, Helmet), funk (Faith No More, Living Colour), rap (Faith No More, Biohazard), industrial (Ministry, Nine Inch Nails), psychedelia (Soundgarden, Monster Magnet), and even world music (later Sepultura). There was no real \"scene,\" just an increased willingness to experiment with a form that had grown overly reliant on pure instrumental technique. Some of those bands eventually broke out to wider audiences, often with help from the Lollapalooza tour, and they also set the stage for a new wave of alt-metal that emerged around 1993-94, centered around the rap-metal fusions of Rage Against the Machine and Korn, the grindingly dissonant Tool, the heavily production-reliant White Zombie, and the popular breakthrough of Nine Inch Nails. These bands would become the most influential forces in shaping the sound and style of alternative metal for the rest of the '90s, along with Pantera, whose thick, molten riffs sounded like no other thrash-metal band. Like many alt-metal bands, Pantera was serious, bleak, and inward-looking, but they demonstrated how to be macho about it. By the latter half of the '90s, most new alt-metal bands were playing some combination of simplified thrash, rap, industrial, hardcore punk, and grunge. This new sound was more about grinding textures and intense aggression than hooks or memorable riffs, and accordingly relied more on studio production to achieve its force; however, it captured the adolescent machismo that has long been mainstream metal's stock in trade, and accordingly became a commercial juggernaut. Korn, Marilyn Manson, and Limp Bizkit were the biggest stars of this new movement -- sometimes dubbed aggro-metal, nu-metal, or (incorrectly) hardcore -- and by the end of the decade, countless new bands were performing that style in a major-label feeding frenzy similar to the proliferation of hair metal bands in the late '80s (ironic, given alternative metal's vehement rejection of hair metal's attitude).

Throughout the early '70s, Southern rock bands formed a major part of the American hard rock band. The first Southern rock band was the Allman Brothers, who elaborated on the improvisational tendencies and loudness of Cream and the Grateful Dead while staying closer to rock & roll's blues and country roots. They were followed shortly afterward by Lynyrd Skynyrd, who played heavier and louder than the Allman Brothers; in the process, they set the template for all the Southern rock bands that followed them. Skynyrd had three lead guitarists, so they naturally indulged themselves in long jams. They also had a sharp songwriter in Ronnie Van Zant, who was able to fuse traditional music with contemporary rock & roll and also had a gift for perceptive lyrics. The bands that followed Skynyrd often lacked a songwriter the stature of Van Zant, but they were able to replicated the group's heavy boogie and long jams. Several bands took the music closer to its country or blues roots, while others, like the Dixie Dregs, developed skilled improvisational technique. Still, the dominant sound of Southern rock was its loose fusion of several rootsy genres and its fondness for heavy boogie jams. The genre died out in the early '80s, after Molly Hatchet, the Marshall Tucker Band, and .38 Special experienced a string of AOR hits, but the spirit of the music lived on in '90s bands like the Black Crowes and Widespread Panic.

Rap-rock was a little more organic, often because it was a rock song where the vocalist rapped instead of sang. Nevertheless, there was certainly elements of hip-hop in the rhythms, too, since there was more funk to rap-rock than normal hard rock.

To be sure, hard rock is loud, aggressive guitar rock, but it isn't as heavy as heavy metal, and it's only very rarely influenced by punk (though it helped inspire punk). Hard rock generally prizes big, stadium-ready guitar riffs, anthemic choruses, and stomping, swaggering backbeats; its goals are usually (though not universally) commercial, and it's nearly always saturated with machismo. With some bands, it can be difficult to tell where the dividing line between hard rock and heavy metal falls, but the basic distinction is that ever since Black Sabbath, metal tends to be darker and more menacing, while hard rock (for the most part) has remained exuberant, chest-thumping party music. Additionally, while metal riffs often function as stand-alone melodies, hard rock riffs tend to outline chord progressions in their hooks, making for looser, more elastic jams should the band decide to stretch out instrumentally. Like heavy metal, hard rock sprang from the mid-'60s intersection of blues-rock and psychedelia pioneered by artists like Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and the Jeff Beck Group. Blues-rock and psychedelia were both exploring the limits of electric amplification, and blues-rock was pushing the repeated guitar riff center stage, while taking some of the swing out of the blues beat and replacing it with a thumping power. Hard rock really came into its own at the dawn of the '70s, with the tough, boozy rock of the Rolling Stones (post-Brian Jones) and Faces, the blues-drenched power and textured arrangements of Led Zeppelin, the post-psychedelic rave-ups of Deep Purple, and the loud, ringing power chords of the Who (circa Who's Next) setting the template for much of what followed. Later in the decade, the lean, stripped-down riffs of AC/DC and Aerosmith, the catchy tunes and stage theatrics of Alice Cooper and Kiss, and the instrumental flash of Van Halen set new trends, though the essential musical blueprint for hard rock remained similar. Arena rock also became a dominant force, stripping out nearly all blues influence and concentrating solely on big, bombastic hooks. During the '80s, hard rock was dominated by glossy pop-metal, although Guns N' Roses, the Black Crowes, and several others did present a grittier, more traditionalist alternative. Old-fashioned hard rock became a scarce commodity in the post-alternative rock era; after grunge, many guitar bands not only adopted a self-consciously serious attitude, but also resisted the urge to write fist-pumping, arena-ready choruses. Still, the '90s did produce a few exceptions, such as Oasis, Urge Overkill, and the serious but anthemic Pearl Jam.            "}

Glam rock was fairly simple, crunchy guitar rock put across with outrageous theatricality. Most of the music was unabashedly catchy, with melodies drawn from teenage bubblegum pop and hip-shaking rhythms from early rock & roll. But those innocent-sounding influences were belied by the delivery, which was all campy, glitzy showmanship and sexuality. In fact, one of the main reasons glam never caught on in the U.S. was that glam artists intentionally played around with gender conventions, dressing themselves up in outlandish, androgynous costumes and makeup. In general, glam rock fell into two schools. The most prevalent one was the intentionally disposable trashiness of T. Rex; leader Marc Bolan pioneered glam's fashion sense and crafted music that was all sexy, silly fun -- or, to put it another way, music where the surface was the substance. Artists like Gary Glitter, Sweet, and Slade followed the T. Rex aesthetic, in the process creating a substyle known as glitter (which was even more exclusively British). But for a style which relied so heavily on image, glam had a surprisingly arty side too, epitomized by David Bowie and Roxy Music. This school was more grandly dramatic and ambitious, both sonically and lyrically; glam was an opportunity for these artists to manipulate their personas at will, making their senses of style part of the overall artistic statement, and exploring the darkness lurking under the music's stylish, glitzy surface. Apart from them, the lone American glam-rock band was the New York Dolls, whose raw, Stonesy proto-punk sounded different from their British peers, but whose trashy aesthetic and transvestite wardrobe clearly put them in the same camp. Glam effectively began with T. Rex's 1971 hit Electric Warrior, but 1972 was its real breakthrough year: T. Rex consolidated its popularity with The Slider; David Bowie released his classic Ziggy Stardust and produced Mott the Hoople's star-making All the Young Dudes album; Roxy Music issued their groundbreaking debut; and the New York Dolls embarked on their first tour of England. Glam rock's creative peak was over by 1975, as most of its remaining major artists were either moving away from the style or releasing subpar work. However, glam had a definite influence on the kids who grew up to head the British punk movement, and an even bigger impact on the theatrical gloom of post-punk. And, of course, glam rock was extremely important to '80s pop-metal, though apart from Def Leppard, many of those bands were American and had minimal knowledge of the original sources.            "}

Glitter made the hooks even bigger and simpler, the lyrics even dumber fun, and was thus able to last for a time on the British pop charts even when, as a whole, the glam movement's heyday began to fade.

Detroit rock was simple, hard-driving, and ultra-high-energy; it was also often raw and grimy, prizing attitude far above polish. The roots of Detroit rock actually extended out to two nearby cities: the industrial Flint and the college town of Ann Arbor, though the most important performance venues (including the Grande Ballroom) were in Detroit itself. The earliest Detroit rock included psychedelia-tinged garage bands like the Amboy Dukes and ? and the Mysterians, as well as hard-rocking blue-eyed soul bands like the Rationals and Mitch Ryder's Detroit Wheels, who were primarily influenced by early R&B and rock & roll (Chuck Berry, Little Richard, etc.). The scene really hit its stride, however, with the massively influential proto-punk of the Stooges and the MC5, both of whom released groundbreaking debut albums in 1969 and continued to put out brilliant records in the early '70s. Commercial they were not, but Detroit rock did have a more accessible side. Grand Funk Railroad and former Amboy Duke Ted Nugent both became superstars in the '70s with their brands of populist hard rock, while Cub Koda's Brownsville Station scored a massive one-off hit with the classic \"Smokin' in the Boys' Room.\" Alice Cooper, a Detroit native who'd been playing Arizona and Los Angeles, returned to the city and streamlined his band's sound to become one of hard rock's greatest performers, while former Ann Arbor garage rocker Bob Seger finally broke through to stardom in the mid-'70s after nearly a decade of recording impassioned, traditionalist rock & roll. Still, the first flowerings of what would become punk rock remain Detroit rock's greatest legacy, and the main reason the scene is still revered.            "}

The one thing that tied all these Album Rock artists together was their dedication to the album as the vehicle for their music, plus their reliance on rock as the foundation of their music. That means album rock consisted of everything from heavy metal and Southern blues-rockers to prog-rock and singer/songwriters with supporting rock bands. It was fairly diverse, actually, but they all shared a certain artistic aesthetic and little bit of indulgence, plus their constant exposure on FM radio. These album rock bands ruled the '70s FM airwaves. They persevered into the '80s, but when album rock radio evolved into classic rock radio, fewer and fewer of their new albums hit the airwaves. By the '90s, album rock acts still turned out new albums, but their older material was heard on the radio -- and usually in the reunion concerts these bands mounted.            "}

The best French pop usually has an elegant, refined sound, but without coming off as distant or unemotional; in fact, the dominant feeling of each song -- romantic longing, nostalgia, sentimentality, eroticism, etc. -- is usually played to the hilt, while retaining the music's Continental stylishness. Prior to World War II, French pop was rooted both in cabaret singing and in the sort of traditional orchestral pop common in the U.S. as well. Performers like Maurice Chevalier and the much-beloved Edith Piaf got their start in this format, becoming wildly popular in their home country and achieving recognition across national borders as well. In the mid-'50s, Belgian-born singer/songwriter Jacques Brel brought a new literacy, wit, and social consciousness to French pop, and became a national legend for his edgy takes on post-WWII society; translated versions of his songs occasionally found their way into the hands of English-speaking pop and rock artists (from Scott Walker to Frank Sinatra) as well. Although French pop continued to be dominated by the cabaret tradition, the sound of American and British pop/rock began to creep in during the '60s. Most of the rock & roll rhythms weren't of the hard-driving variety -- rather, they drew from more compatible styles like American girl-group pop (especially singer/songwriter Fran\u00e7oise Hardy), pre-British Invasion dance crazes like the Twist, and the orchestrated, groovy, swinging-London sound of British singers like Petula Clark. Actress and international sex symbol Brigitte Bardot launched her singing career in this fashion with the help of songwriter Serge Gainsbourg; as a performer, Gainsbourg quickly became a European superstar in his own right, thanks to the simmering eroticism of his arrangements and rhythm tracks, not to mention the outrageous provocations of his lyrics and album concepts. Rock & roll and club-oriented dance music eventually eroded French pop's hegemony both in France and in other parts of Europe, but classic performers who have managed to stick around can still command sizable audiences.

Often, it's performed by teens, as well. Of course, music made for teenagers has been around since the dawn of the modern recording industry, from the bobby-socked girls that swooned for Sinatra to the legions of fans of Fabian or the Bay City Rollers, but teen pop is the teen music made during the late '80s and '90s. It had its first great flourish in the last years of the decade, as Tiffany, Debbie Gibson, and New Kids on the Block rode to stardom on their lite, catchy, commercial dance-pop tunes and adult contemporary ballads. NKOTB, in particular, set the template for the genre, as they name-dropped hip urban trends while remaining completely wholesome and cutely commercial. During the first two years of the '90s, teen pop dominated American charts, but once Nirvana crossed over into the mainstream, it was done for. At least, that's how it appeared. In reality, it went underground and across the sea, where Take That ruled the U.K. charts with records that were equal parts NKOTB and George Michael. They had a few peers that remained British sensations, but Take That were the undisputed kings of teen pop. Just as they were on the brink of American success with their 1994 single \"Back for Good,\" they imploded, just as British teens became fascinated with Brit-pop, the U.K. equivalent of the grunge revolution. For a brief time, there was no teen pop on either side of the Atlantic, but that all changed once the Spice Girls released their debut single, \"Wannabe\" in the summer of 1996. A photogenic, cleverly-marketed five-piece, the Spice Girls were sensations throughout the U.K., and spread like wildfire in the U.S. in 1997. Their success opened the doors for a wave of teen pop that was stronger than that in the late '80s. Hanson was the first out of the gate in 1997 with their spruced-up oldies rock, and then the Backstreet Boys eclipsed all of their peers during 1998 with a string of hit singles. Others followed in their shadow, whether it was the very similar 'N Sync or the Spice Girls-styled All Saints. In 1999, teen pop showed no signs of decline, as it produced a new trend -- the pop Lolita. Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera weren't out of their teens, but they strutted like Madonna in her prime and had music that was nearly as suggestive. Both Spears and Aguilera sold millions of records, just like the Backstreets and 'N Sync, proving that it wasn't just teenage girls buying teen pop in the late '90s, arguably the style's golden era.

The genesis for dance-rock was the mid-'70s, when the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Rod Stewart, and Queen all flirted (at one time or another) with the simpler rhythms and heavy groove of funk and disco. Then, influenced by varied sources (including most of the above), many of the biggest alternative crossover acts of the '80s -- Duran Duran, INXS, Pet Shop Boys, ABC, Eurythmics, the B-52's, Depeche Mode, New Order -- fused dance and rock in some manner. They may have relied on keyboards and drum machines or used the standard guitar-bass-drums format of most rock bands, but they were performing many songs in a way that was perfectly primed for the dancefloor, with simple, heavily repetitive choruses or hooks, more reliance on the low end than usual (sometimes even leaving the guitars in the background), and a habit for releasing white-label 12\" singles with even more danceable remixes on the B-side. The reinvention of U2 on 1991's Achtung Baby was a pivotal moment for dance-rock, happening late in the game but showing that even the biggest young band in the world had an eye on the dancefloor (especially so, considering U2 had spent much of the '80s far away from dance). Dance-rock embraced a large group of artists, everything from the deconstructivist funk of A Certain Ratio and Gang of Four to the heavy pop slant of Robert Palmer or Hall & Oates. It was also very long-lived, gathering additional influences from the electronic dance revolution of the late '80s, and showing up in the work of commercial acts like Garbage, No Doubt, Robbie Williams, and Scissor Sisters.

Exotica is usually arranged for standard orchestras, with instrumentation added according to the location being evoked (ethnic percussion, string instruments, etc.); some exotica also borrows the weird, otherworldly sound effects that define the space-age pop style. Even in its '50s/early-'60s heyday, exotica was often derided as cheesy and contrived, but its '90s revival among alternative music fans embraced those very qualities (albeit ironically), and also brought a sincere reassessment of the music's inventive production techniques.

An experienced listener can generally tell what job was originally performed to the rhythm of a tune; sail-hauling shanties have a different beat than pumping shanties, rowing shanties, and capstan or windlass shanties. What many shanties have in common is call-and-response vocals and a yelp or shout at the end of each chorus. (The latter was a signal to pull on a rope or put extra effort into raising an anchor.) The subjects of shanties vary widely, from tales of the sea and reminiscences of ladies left behind to nonsensical rhymes and ribald boasting. Though English-language shanties are perhaps best known there are popular shanties in many languages, and the largest regularly held shanty festival is staged annually in Poland.  In recent years folk artists have created many original tunes in the style of sea shanties, and many bands have added a few shanties to their repertoire to add color to their set.Note: There is some disagreement about the reason for the name of the style. Some experts refer to the chanted quality of the vocals, while others point to the fact that fishermen traditionally lived in shacks called shantys.

Centered around stringed instruments -- fiddle, guitar, bass, mandolin, banjo, dulcimer, etc. -- and rudimentary percussion (if any), Appalachian folk largely descended from English and Scots-Irish folk traditions, brought to the region by colonial immigrants seeking territory and farmland to call their own; there were also smaller influences from other European immigrants, African-Americans, and Native Americans. Because of the rugged landscape, transportation and communication were difficult, leaving the region's culture and music to develop in relative isolation over the course of the 1800s. Life in the mountains was often tough and lonely, and music became the most popular means of expression and entertainment. Appalachian folk songs were simple and covered all facets of everyday life, both extraordinary and run-of-the-mill -- work (especially coal mining, logging, and working on the river), love, death, religion (including many traditional hymns), and murder (the famed ballad of \"Tom Dooley\" originated here). Known as old-timey music or hillbilly music, Appalachian folk began to find popular acceptance during the 1920s thanks in part to its traditional values, which were also fairly well ingrained in the culture at large. The recordings of the Carter Family helped preserve crucial parts of the Appalachian folk repertoire, and helped pave the way for both country music and, especially, bluegrass (birthed in the '40s thanks to the work of Bill Monroe). Evolution of the Appalachian folk tradition was inevitable by this point, since the music's popularity was accompanied by hordes of talent scouts, opening both the region and its performers up to a great deal of outside influence. However, even if Appalachian folk is no longer a thriving tradition (due mainly to ever-increasing outside influence and a population exodus from the still-impoverished area), the music is still the subject of much preservationist fascination, and has become virtually synonymous with American folk tradition.

The soundtrack to the 2000 film O Brother Where Art Thou found surprising success on the Billboard charts and ended up helping to revive the earnest feel of the acoustic folk music from the first half of the 20th century.

The presence of LSD on the Goa scene -- instead of the ubiquitous club drug Ecstasy -- translated the music into an appropriately psychedelic version of trance that embraced the mystical properties of Indian music and culture. Traditional Indian instruments such as the sitar and sarod (or electronic near-equivalents) often made appearances in the music, pushed along by the driving, hypnotic sequencer music that trance had always been known for. The style is considerably less turntable-oriented than other electronic dance styles, especially since vinyl tends to melt in the heat (DATs are often used instead). As a consequence, Goa had comparatively few DJs to recommend it worldwide until the late '90s. Labels like Dragonfly, Blue Room Released, Flying Rhino, Platipus, and Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto Fluoro became important sources for the sound. Oakenfold, Britain's most popular DJ, finally gave Goa trance the cache it had lacked in the past by caning it on the radio and in clubs across the country.

Raves were underground parties where acid house and hardcore records were played and large quantities of drugs -- particularly ecstasy -- were consumed. Most of the music played at raves had a psychedelic quality, even before drugs became a major element of the scene. DJs played at the raves, mixing stacks of house and techno singles; the DJs, not the recording artists themselves, became the most recognizable names in the scene. Raves were primarily an English phenomenon during the late '80s and early '90s. They were conducted in large venues, particularly abandoned warehouses and open fields. Eventually, the British government became concerned that raves were a dangerous, antisocial phenomenon that had to be shut down, but the parties never disappeared, especially since word of the events were usually passed through word of mouth and handmade fliers. In the States, raves began to make some inroads in the early '90s, but they never gained a large audience, even by underground standards. Throughout the '90s, bands that were directly influenced by rave culture -- particularly \"baggy\" bands like the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, and Charlatans; Britpop acts like Pulp and Oasis; and techno artists like the Prodigy -- made their way into the mainstream, and the culture continued to capture the attention of British youth into the late '90s.

The style originally emerged from Great Britain's 1988 Summer of Love; though the original soundtrack to those warehouse parties was influenced by the relatively midtempo rhythms of Chicago acid house, increased drug intake caused many ravers to embrace quicker rhythms and altogether more frenetic forms of music. Many DJs indulged their listeners by speeding up house records originally intended for 33-rpm play, and producers carried the torch by sampling the same records for their releases. During 1991-92, hardcore/rave music had hit the legitimate airwaves as well, led by hits like SL2's \"On a Ragga Tip,\" T-99's \"Anasthasia,\" and RTS' \"Poing.\"The resulting major-label feeding frenzy produced heavy coverage for lightweight novelty fare like \"Go Speed Go\" by Alpha Team, \"Sesame's Treat\" by Smart E's, and \"James Brown Is Dead\" by L.A. Style. By 1993, British producers like Rob Playford, 4 Hero, and Omni Trio began leading hardcore techno into the breakbeat territory that would later become known as jungle, even as the Teutonic end of hardcore morphed into harder trance and gabba.During the mid-'90s, most ravers had grown out of the dance scene or simply tired of the sound; though the original hardcore/rave sound had spread to much of the British hinterlands as well as continental Europe, most Londoners favored progressive house or the emerging ambient techno. The simultaneous lack of critical coverage but wide spread of the sound -- into the north of England and Scotland as well as the continental centers of Germany and the Netherlands -- served to introduce a variety of underground styles, from the digital hardcore of Germany's Alec Empire to English happy hardcore.

The jungle/drum'n'bass movement had also emerged from rave, but the two scenes split and grew quite anathemic. The positive vibes of happy hardcore were criticized by most clubgoers as music for the drugged-out youth, but just as the hardcore-into-jungle scene found favor with critics later in the decade, a certain amount of respect for happy hardcore appeared as well.

While essentially designed as dance music meant to uplift, the stark, melancholy edge of early tracks by Cybotron, Model 500, Rhythm Is Rhythm, and Reese also spoke to Detroit's economic collapse in the late '70s following the city's prosperous heyday as the focal point of the American automobile industry.The music's oft-copied ruddy production and stripped-down aesthetic were largely a function of the limited technology available to the early innovators (records were often mastered from two-track onto cassette). The increasingly sophisticated arrangements of contemporary techno (on through to hardcore and jungle), conversely, has much to do with the growth and increasing affordability of MIDI-encoded equipment and desktop digital audio. Second- and third-wave Detroit techno, too, has gained considerably in production, although artists such as Derrick May, Juan Atkins, and Kenny Larkin have sought to combine the peerless sheen of the digital arena with the compositional minimalism of their Detroit origins.No longer simply contained within the 313 area code, Detroit techno has become a global phenomenon (partly as a result of the more widespread acclaim many of the original Detroit artists have found in other countries), buoyed by the fact that many of the classic early tracks remain in print (available through Submerge). Today, Detroit's third wave is re-exploring the aesthetic commitment of the music's early period, with hard-hitting beats (Underground Resistance, Jeff Mills), soulful grooves (Kenny Larkin, Stacey Pullen), and a renewed interest in techno's breakbeat roots (Aux 88, Drexciya, \"Mad\" Mike, Dopplereffekt).

Mixing elements of the house music that was already up and running in Chicago (as well as New York) with the squelchy sounds and deep bassline of the Roland TB-303 synthesizer, acid house was strictly a Chicago phenomenon until stacks of singles began to cross the Atlantic, arriving in the hands of eager young Brits. The sound jelled in small warehouse parties held in London in 1986-87, and then went overground during 1988's infamous Summer of Love, when thousands of clubgoers traveled to the hinterlands for the massive events later known as raves. Acid house hit the British pop charts quite quickly, with M/A/R/R/S, S'Express, and Technotronic landing huge hits before the dawn of the '90s. By that time, the acid house phenomenon had largely passed in England and was replaced by rave music. New-school U.S. producers from Cajmere to Armand Van Helden to Felix Da Housecat kept the sound alive and well during the '90s.            "}

Born in the late '80s, the sound grew out of a fusion between the hard-edged dance music heard on the main floor at raves and larger club events, and the more downtempo music of the nearby chill-out rooms. DJs like Mixmaster Morris and Dr. Alex Paterson blended Chicago house, softer synth-pop/new wave, and ambient/environmental music, prompting a wave of producers inspired by a variety of sources. (Many DJs and producers were also reacting against the increasingly chart-leaning slant of British dance music during those years, exemplified by novelty hits like \"Pump Up the Jam\" by Technotronic and \"Sesame's Treat\" by Smart E's.) Sheffield's Warp Records proved home to the best in the sound -- in fact, the seminal Warp compilation Artificial Intelligence alone introduced listeners worldwide to a half-dozen of the style's most crucial artists: Aphex Twin, the Orb, Plastikman, Autechre, Black Dog Productions, and B12. Other labels -- Rising High, GPR, R&S, Rephlex, Fat Cat, Astralwerks -- released quality IDM as well, though by the mid-'90s much of the electronica produced for headphone consumption had diverged either toward the path of more experimentation or more beat orientation. With no centered, commercial scene to speak of, North America became a far more hospitable clime to IDM, and by the end of the '90s, dozens of solid labels had opened for business, including Drop Beat, Isophlux, Suction, Schematic, and Cytrax. Despite frequent attempts to rename the style (Warp's \"electronic listening music\" and Aphex Twin's \"braindance\" were two choices), IDM continued to be the de facto way for fans to describe their occasionally undescribable favorites.

No longer was the artist confined to sequenced percussion, synth, and samples, but rather any imaginable sound, including the uncanny realm of digital glitches -- a possibility that was quickly exploited by a generation of youths with the means to create entire albums in their bedroom with only a computer and some software. Where early-'90s analog-toting pioneers such as Aphex Twin and Autechre had envisioned the quickly diminishing areas of electronica that had not yet been explored, and simultaneously, another insular group of pioneers led by Robert Hood and Basic Channel stripped away the elements of electronica that had ultimately become little more than ineffective clich\u00e9, a second wave of computer-armed prot\u00e9g\u00e9s studied these aesthetics and used software to create microscopically intricate compositions harking back to these pioneers. First championed by the ideological German techno figure Achim Szepanski and his stable of record labels -- Force Inc, Mille Plateaux, Force Tracks, Ritornell -- this tight-knit scene of experimental artists creating cerebral hybrids of experimental techno, minimalism, digital collage, and noise glitches soon found themselves being assembled into a community. Though artists such as Oval, Pole, and Vladislav Delay, among others, had initially been singled out by critics beforehand, Mille Plateaux's epic Clicks_+_Cuts compilation first defined the underground movement, exploring not only a broad roster of artists but also a wide scope of approaches. The artists on the compilation, along with a small community of visionary artists in the software-savvy San Francisco/Silicon Valley area of California led by the Cytrax label, soon found themselves as the critically hailed leaders of yet another electronica movement. It wasn't long before the glitch aesthetic began being crossbred with existing genres, resulting in endless variations on the aesthetic, such as MRI's click-driven house and Kid 606's noise remix of N.W.A's \"Straight Outta Compton.\"            "}

If the scene was centered at all, it occurred at Hard Wax Records, a record store as well as a tight distribution company that was home to several of the style's crucial labels (Basic Channel, Chain Reaction, Imbalance) and producers (Maurizio, Mark Ernestus, Porter Ricks, Pole, Monolake). Indebted to Chicago acid house and minimalist Detroit techno figures like Jeff Mills, Rob Hood, and Plastikman, experimental dub was rather easily characterized; the sound usually focused on a mix of crackling, murky atmospheres that sounded almost subaquatic, with a midtempo beat and strong, clanging percussion. The similarities to classic Jamaican dub producers King Tubby and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry were indirect at best, but the term worked well for identifying the signature sound of many of Germany's best experimental producers. Other than the Basic Channel camp, experimental dub's most important figures were Mike Ink (aka Wolfgang Voigt) and Thomas Brinkmann. Ink, a longtime Berlin producer responsible for more than a half-dozen aliases and labels, did most of his important work on the Profan and Studio 1 labels. Brinkmann, a comparative newcomer to the style, earned praise for his remixes of material by Ink and Plastikman. Experimental dub, in turn, inspired several major techno figures (including Plastikman and Mills) by the late '90s, and its influence was even seen in American indie rock and post-rock.

True artists in the genre also create their own sounds (as opposed to using the preset sounds that come with modern synthesizers). In progressive electro-acoustic music, the electronics play an equal if not greater part in the overall concept. Acoustic instruments performed in real time are usually processed through reverb, harmonizing, and so on, which adds an entirely new dimension to the player's technique. At best, this music opens up new worlds of listening, thinking, and feeling.

These sound chips were used in early '80s computers like the Commodore 64, as well as video game consoles including the Nintendo Entertainment System the Atari 400 and 800, which is why the chips' bleeps and bloops often suggest vintage video game music. Unlike the sample-based synthesis of later computers, these chips had very simple tone and noise generators that offered square and pulse wave instruments and white noise percussion. However, clever composers found ways to make the most of this limited sonic palette, from using arpeggios to suggest chords to employing wavetable synthesis to color the sound. Chiptune, the first and strictest eight-bit music style, began as music featuring only the sounds from sound chips. Along with video game music, it is also closely related to the demoscene, where artists showcase their skill at making audio-visual presentations on early home computers like the Amiga and Commodore 64. Chiptune flourished in the '80s and early '90s, but its influence continued into the 2000s, even when artists used computers with full sample playback capability: Sweden's Role Model (aka Johan Kotlinski) and Japan's YMCK developed emulators and plug-ins that brought the eight-bit sound to more contemporary and complex computers. Bitpop and 8-bit were among the terms used to describe music made with eight-bit sounds as well as other instrumentation ranging from other electronics to live instruments. 8 Bit Weapon, Pixelh8, Crystal Castles, Team Doyobi, DAT Politics and Freezepop are among the artists spanning the spectrum of chiptune and bitpop.

The blazing success of the KLF during 1990-91 sustained newbeat for awhile, but after their exit from the music industry, the style faded quickly.

Regional pockets around the world had emphasized the \"less intelligent\" side of dance music as early as 1994, in reaction to the growing coterie of chin-stroking intellectuals attached to the drum'n'bass and experimental movements. Big beat as a distinct movement finally coalesced in 1995-96 around two British labels: Brighton's Skint and London's Wall of Sound. The former -- home to releases by Fatboy Slim, Bentley Rhythm Ace, and Lo-Fidelity Allstars -- deserves more honors for innovation and quality, though Wall of Sound was founded slightly earlier and released great singles by Propellerheads, Wiseguys, and Les Rythmes Digitales. Big beat soon proved very popular in America as well, and artists attached to City of Angels Records (the Crystal Method, \u00dcberzone, Lunatic Calm, Front BC) gained a higher profile thanks to like-minded Brits. Other than Fatboy Slim, the other superstar artists of big beat were the Chemical Brothers and Prodigy, two groups who predated the style (and assisted its birth). Both the Chemical Brothers and Prodigy were never tight fits either, given productions that often reflected the more intelligent edge of trip-hop, and rarely broke into the mindless arena of true big beat.The sound of big beat, a rather shameless fusion of old-school party breakbeats with appropriately off-the-wall samples, was reminiscent of house music's sampladelic phase of the late '80s as well as old-school rap and its penchant for silly samples and irresistible breaks. Though the sample programming and overall production was leaps and bounds beyond its predecessors, big beat was nevertheless criticized for dumbing down the electronica wave of the late '90s. Even while recordings by the Chemical Brothers, Prodigy, and Fatboy Slim hit the American charts and earned positive reviews -- granted, from rock critics -- worldwide, many dance fans rejected the style wholesale for being too reliant on gimmicky production values and played-out samples. Big beat lasted a surprisingly long time, given the constraints of a style reliant on the patience of listeners who've heard the same break dozens of times, as well as the patience of DJs to hunt local thrift stores to find interesting samples on old instructional records.

Although soloists follow the chords as in bop, the basslines (often played by an organist if not a string bassist) dance rather than stick strictly to a four-to-the bar walking pattern. The musicians build their accompaniment around the bassline and, although there are often strong melodies, it is the catchiness of the groove and the amount of heat generated by the soloists that determine whether the performance is successful. Soul-jazz's roots trace back to pianist Horace Silver, whose funky style infused bop with the influence of church and gospel music, along with the blues. Other pianists who followed and used similar approaches were Bobby Timmons, Junior Mance, Les McCann, Gene Harris (with his Three Sounds), and Ramsey Lewis. With the emergence of organist Jimmy Smith in 1956 (who has dominated his instrument ever since), soul-jazz organ combos (usually also including a tenor, guitarist, drummer, and an occasional bassist) caught on, and soulful players became stars, including Brother Jack McDuff, Shirley Scott, Jimmy McGriff, Charles Earland, and Richard \"Groove\" Holmes, along with such other musicians as guitarists Grant Green, George Benson and Kenny Burrell; tenors Stanley Turrentine, Willis \"Gator\" Jackson, Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis, David \"Fathead\" Newman, Gene \"Jug\" Ammons, Houston Person, Jimmy Forrest, King Curtis, Red Holloway, and Eddie Harris; and altoist Hank Crawford.

In that respect, it was fairly similar to soul-jazz, but where soul-jazz was often content to lay back in the groove, jazz-funk drove forward with a stronger, more pronounced backbeat, as well as a more explicit devotion to the Stax/Volt brand of soul music (sometimes reflected in cover versions of popular soul hits). Many early jazz-funk artists were organists, like Lonnie Smith, Reuben Wilson, Charles Earland, and Jack McDuff (some of whom crossed freely between jazz-funk and soul-jazz); other key figures included saxophonist Eddie Harris and vibraphonist Roy Ayers. As the grittier strain of soul metamorphosed into funk during the early '70s, and as fusion helped make funk rhythms a compelling way for some hard boppers to reconnect with their African-American audience, the crucial R&B component of jazz-funk shifted with the times. Artists like trumpeter Donald Byrd, flautist Bobbi Humphrey, and keyboardist Ronnie Foster crafted a sunny, breezy style by performing compositions which often simply resembled jazzy R&B, and drew from Philly soul as well as funk. Keyboardists like Herbie Hancock and Lonnie Liston Smith explored a spacier, more atmospheric brand of jazz-funk, while the artists on Creed Taylor's CTI label (most prominently Freddie Hubbard) were wrapped in a shinier, more polished production. Fusion and jazz-funk shared many sensibilities during the early '70s, but it's important to realize that not all fusion was jazz-funk, and vice versa. Fusion could encompass a greater variety of moods and influences, whereas jazz-funk was always marked by its devotion to R&B, and maintained the upbeat, celebratory vibe of funk. Just as funk was eventually smoothed out into disco, jazz-funk melted into the smoother, more polished brand of crossover-oriented fusion that dominated the popular, more accessible side of jazz during the '80s and '90s. Because of its emphasis on danceable, funky grooves, jazz-funk became highly popular in the British underground music scene (where it was known as \"rare groove\") when it was rediscovered during the mid- to late '80s; an update version mixed with funk and hip-hop became known as acid jazz. For similar reasons, jazz-funk was also the style to which many American hip-hop artists turned when looking for ways to fuse jazz and rap; Roy Ayers, in particular, enjoyed a renaissance and reappraisal in both scenes. Plus, artists like Medeski, Martin & Wood helped revive the classic jazz-funk sound and bring it to newer, wider audiences in the '90s.            "}

It was performed by immensely talented pianists who were able to control the piano with a power and virtuosic force previously unknown in popular music. The style originated in New York before the 1920s, as pianists took ragtime and began developing new, more swinging styles. Major proponents were James P.  Johnson, Willie \"The Lion\" Smith, and Luckey Roberts. They influenced Fats Waller, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Joe Sullivan -- who, in turn, went on to be influential themselves.

Novelty ragtime (sometimes referred to as novelty piano) was actually more sophisticated than standard ragtime, with its name coming from its comparatively off-kilter feel, not because it was goofy or disposable. Its mostly classically trained composers made greater use of chromaticism, and its more complex rhythmic syncopations and melodies demanded flashier technical displays from the pianists who performed in the style (in fact, novelty ragtime originated as a piano-roll form). Despite its more complicated musical embellishments, novelty ragtime was looser and more swinging than ragtime, especially in the way its melodies matched up with the underlying rhythms. Arguably the first novelty ragtime compositions appeared in 1921 in the form of \"Kitten on the Keys\" and \"My Pet,\" both written by pianist Zez Confrey, generally acknowledged to be the style's most accomplished adherent.

However with the success of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1917 and the many performances documented in the 1920s, it became possible to hear what this music sounded like in later years. Ensemble-oriented with fairly strict roles for each instrument, New Orleans Jazz generally features a trumpet or cornet providing a melodic lead, harmonies from the trombone, countermelodies by the clarinet, and a steady rhythm stated by the rhythm section (which usually consists of piano, banjo or guitar, tuba, or bass and drums). This music is a direct descendant of marching brass bands and, although overlapping with Dixieland, tends to de-emphasize solos in favor of ensembles featuring everyone playing and improvising together.

Mainstream, which was fairly well documented in the 1950s, was completely overshadowed by other styles in the '60s and its original players gradually passed away.

Although nearly any song can be turned into Dixieland, there is a consistent repertoire of 40 or so songs that have proven to be reliable.

This could be expressed as a walking octave, an open-fifth pounded out with a blue third thrown in, or even a simple figure such as falling triad (as in the work of Jimmy Yancey); the approach varies to the pianist. The style probably evolved in the American Midwest alongside that of ragtime, to which it is closely related. The earliest description of the style occurs in print circa 1880. Elements of boogie-woogie can be found prior to 1910 in piano works by such disparate figures such as Blind Boone, Luckey Roberts and the classical composer Charles Ives. The earliest recorded examples of boogie woogie are found on piano rolls made in 1922 by Cow Cow Davenport, and by the end of the 1920s dozens of boogie woogie pianists had recorded ranging geographically from Texas to Chicago. Boogie-woogie practically disappeared from records during the depression. However, it returned with a vengeance in the late '30s, popularized by a smart Deane Kincaide arrangement for Tommy Dorsey\u2019s band of the 1929 composition \"Boogie Woogie\" written by Clarence \"Pine Top\" Smith, a Chicago pianist who is also credited with coining the term. Boogie-woogie enjoyed its heyday in the early '40s, and as a result, one-time Chicago barrelhouse pianists such as Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis and Pete Johnson found themselves feted as celebrities in New York\u2019s exclusive caf\u00e9 society circles. After the Second World War interest in the style subsided, but elements of the sound were absorbed into the playing of early rock & roll artists such as Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. It also remains an important component to New Orleans pop music, as in the work of Professor Longhair and Dr. John. Among living pianists working in nightclubs and cocktail bars, it can be said that boogie-woogie has never truly lost its popularity even today.             "}

Before the advent of modal music in the '50s, solo improvisations were based around the specific key of a piece -- that is, its tonal center, the starting point to which its melodies and chord progressions would return for a feeling of resolution or completeness. Modal improvisations, on the other hand, were based on modes, or scales -- but not just the typical major and minor scales familiar to nearly all musicians. The most commonly used modes did relate to major scales, though; each note in the scale was also the first note of a new mode, which would incorporate all of the notes in the original major scale, but sounded different because the new starting point rearranged the order of distances between notes. Thus, if a musician were improvising over, say, a D chord, he could essentially choose any key center whose corresponding scale included the note D (unless the composer dictated specific modes to be used in the solos). The new order of distances between notes could produce very different moods -- for example, even though the C major and A minor scales use exactly the same notes, the former sounds bright and happy, whereas the latter is more melancholy. Because the feeling of the music came from those note choices, chord progressions in modal music were usually kept very simple, since too much motion would have allowed little time to fully explore the mode(s) that had been selected. The results often had a meditative, cerebral feel, but weren't quite as mellow as, for example, West Coast-style cool jazz. Modal music had a subtle tension produced by the fact that the solo lines, while melodic, didn't always progress or resolve exactly as the listener was accustomed to hearing; plus, every time a new mode was introduced, the tonal center shifted, keeping the listener just off balance with a subtle unpredictability. Miles Davis was the first jazz musician to improvise and compose according to modal structure; his Kind of Blue is the definitive modal jazz album, and two of his sidemen on the record -- John Coltrane and Bill Evans -- later went on to become modal innovators in their own right. The freedoms of modal music helped pave the way for the rabid structural experimentation of avant-garde jazz, which would begin to take shape toward the end of the '50s.            "}

Since the prime time period of hard bop (1955-70) was a decade later than bop, these differences were a logical evolution and one can think of hard bop as bop of the '50s and '60s. By the second half of the 1960s, the influence of the avant garde was being felt and some of the more adventurous performances of the hard bop stylists (such as Jackie McLean and Lee Morgan) fell somewhere between the two styles. With the rise of fusion and the sale of Blue Note (hard bop's top label) in the late '60s, the style fell on hard times although it was revived to a certain extent in the 1980s. Much of the music performed by the so-called Young Lions during the latter decade (due to other influences altering their style) was considered modern mainstream, although some groups (such as the Harper Brothers and T.S.

However, the true birth of Afro-Cuban jazz can be traced to trumpeter-arranger Mario Bauza. Bauza introduced trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie to the masterful Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo (they teamed up in 1947-48 to create innovative music before Pozo's death) and also persuaded Latin bandleader Machito to use jazz soloists.

After trumpeter Miles Davis' polarizing 1969 fusion landmark Bitches Brew, purists argued that fusion, with its reliance on rock-oriented beats and electric instrumentation, was not \u201creal\u201d jazz. Thus, the term straight-ahead jazz was coined to refer to jazz that ignored the rock-leaning sound. Jazz labels began springing up to record and release straight-ahead albums, the most notable being Concord Records, founded in 1972 by promoter Carl Jefferson as an extension of his Concord Jazz Festival. But the straight-ahead aesthetic came into sharpest focus in 1980 with the release of trumpeter Wynton Marsalis' self-titled debut album.

Jazz has a well-established custom of using pop standards as jumping-off points for lengthy improvisations, satisfying jazz lovers and purists who appreciate the unpredictability and constant chance-taking. However, ever since the big-band era, there has also been a long-standing tradition of Jazz-Pop -- music that retains the melodic and rhythmically swinging qualities of jazz (as well as the basic chordal harmonies), but which (like pop) concentrates first and foremost on memorable melodies, usually with little to no improvisation.In jazz's early days, dance orchestras began to adopt swing rhythms to keep in step with audience tastes. As the big band era wore on, most groups fell into one of two categories: sweet bands, which retained at least a lightly swinging feel but prized melody above all else, and hot bands, which were distinguished by greater solo improvisation, rhythmic drive, and blues feeling. Sweet bands helped pave the way for the rise of pop singers like Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, and Mel Torm\u00e9, who were at the very least strongly influenced by jazz.But really, when most listeners think of jazz-pop, they think of it in the post-rock & roll era. During the '60s, two dominant strains of jazz-pop developed. The first was a mellow, smooth, almost easy-listening strain of jazzy pop epitomized by artists like the Dixieland-influenced Al Hirt and the Latin-tinged Herb Alpert. The other sprang up as a sort of middle ground between the grooving, funky soul-jazz that became popular during the decade, and instrumental soul artists like Junior Walker and the Stax/Volt combos (Booker T. & the MG's, the Mar-Keys, the Bar-Kays). In this vein, the Ramsey Lewis Trio scored a pop smash in 1965 with their catchy \"The In Crowd,\" and the trio's rhythm section -- reconstituted as Young-Holt Unlimited -- repeated the feat in 1969 with \"Soulful Strut.\"As fusion introduced rock and funk rhythms into the vocabularies of more and more jazz artists, jazz-pop began to mirror the shifting musical landscape, in the process reaching a wider audience than ever before. Artists like Chuck Mangione, Spyro Gyra, Bob James, and George Benson became stars in the mid- to late '70s, with the balance between pop, jazz, and R&B influences varying according to the individual. Purists and many critics decried the slick polish and simplicity of the new breed of jazz-pop, plus what they viewed as commercial pandering and blandly pleasant predictability; during the '80s, their concerns came to be symbolized by the wildly popular soprano saxophonist Kenny G, who sold millions of albums and proved that instrumental jazz-pop could cross over to pop and adult contemporary audiences. During the '90s, Kenny G's success helped give rise to the smooth jazz radio format, which steered jazz-pop in a similarly polished, pleasantly soothing direction.            "}

But as rock became more creative and its musicianship improved, and as some in the jazz world became bored with hard bop and did not want to play strictly avant-garde music, the two different idioms began to trade ideas and occasionally combine forces. By the early '70s, fusion had its own separate identity as a creative jazz style (although snubbed by many purists) and such major groups as Return to Forever, Weather Report, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, and Miles Davis' various bands were playing high-quality fusion that mixed some of the best qualities of jazz and rock. Unfortunately, as it became a money-maker and as rock declined artistically from the mid-'70s on, much of what was labeled fusion was actually a combination of jazz with easy-listening pop music and lightweight R&B. The promise of fusion went unfulfilled to an extent, although it continued to exist in groups such as Tribal Tech and Chick Corea's Elektric Band.            "}

Jazz-rock first emerged during the late '60s as an attempt to fuse the visceral power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational fireworks of jazz. Since rock often emphasized directness and simplicity over virtuosity, jazz-rock generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late '60s and early '70s: psychedelia, progressive rock, and the singer/songwriter movement. The latter drew from the mellower, more cerebral side of jazz, often employing vocal as well as instrumental improvisation; this school's major figures included Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, and Tim Buckley. Most jazz-rock, however, was played by higher-energy rock ensembles. Some of them were more jam-oriented, borrowing jazz harmonies and instruments for their extended, rock-flavored improvisations (Traffic, Santana). Others recorded jazz-flavored R&B or pop songs that used the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic sensibilities of jazz, but weren't as interested in improvisation or instrumental virtuosity (Blood, Sweat & Tears, Chicago, Steely Dan). Still others used jazz's complexity to expand rock's musical horizons, not just in terms of instrumental technique but in crafting quirky, challenging, unpredictable compositions (Frank Zappa, the Soft Machine). The major exception was Miles Davis, the first jazz musician since the early R&B era to covet the earthy power of rock & roll and the impact it had on young audiences. Starting with 1970's Bitches Brew, Davis' early-'70s fusion workouts -- greatly inspired by Jimi Hendrix and Sly & the Family Stone -- quickly became some of the funkiest, edgiest, most aggressive jazz-rock ever recorded. While figures like Zappa and $Steely Dan continued to record jazz-rock through the '70s, the movement had essentially dissipated by the '80s, as a mellower form of fusion captured its audience.

Free Jazz was a radical departure from past styles, for typically after playing a quick theme, the soloist does not have to follow any progression or structure and can go in any unpredictable direction. When Ornette Coleman largely introduced free jazz to New York audiences (although Cecil Taylor had preceded him with less publicity), many bop musicians and fans debated about whether what was being played would even qualify as music; the radicals had become conservatives in less than 15 years. Free jazz, which overlaps with the avant garde (the latter can use arrangements and sometimes fairly tight frameworks), remains a controversial and mostly underground style, influencing the modern mainstream while often being ignored. Having dispensed with many of the rules as far as pitch, rhythm, and development are concerned (although it need not be atonal or lack a steady pulse to be free jazz), the success of a free jazz performance can be measured by the musicianship and imagination of the performers, how colorful the music is, and whether it seems logical or merely random.

At the same time, since it was proven that electric jazz could sell records, producers and some musicians searched for other combinations of styles in order to have big sellers. They were quite successful in making their brand of jazz more accessible to the average consumer. Many different combinations were tried, and promoters and publicists enjoy using the term \"contemporary jazz\" to describe these \"fusions\" of jazz with elements of pop music, R&B, and world music. However, the word \"crossover\" (which describes the intent of the performances as well as the usual results) is more accurate. Crossover and fusion have been quite valuable in increasing the jazz audience (many of whom end up exploring other styles). In some cases, the music is quite worthwhile; in other instances, the jazz content is a relatively small part of the ingredients. When the style is actually pop music with only an insignificant amount of improvisation (meaning that it is largely outside of jazz), the term \"instrumental pop\" is the best description. Examples of crossover range from Al Jarreau and George Benson vocal records to Kenny G., Spyro Gyra, and the Rippingtons.

Most attempts at fusing the two very different idioms have been (at best) mixed successes with string sections weighing down jazz soloists. In the 1920s, Paul Whiteman alternated between symphonic string sections and classic jazz solos. Strings were used in some swing bands in the 1940s (most inventively by Artie Shaw and Stan Kenton's dissonant works of 1950-51) but in all cases the added musicians were merely reading their parts and backing the improvisers. Starting with Charlie Parker in 1949, jazz players recorded now and then (while joined by strings), but it was not until the mid-to-late '50s that more serious experiments began to take place. Schuller, John Lewis, J.J. Johnson, and Bill Russo were some of the more significant composers attempting to bridge the gap between jazz and classical music. Most musical forecasters in the mid-'50s would have predicted that jazz's next phase would involve a fusion of sorts with classical music, but the rise of the avant garde (which has a spontaneity and an extrovertism that most pseudo-classical works lack) largely ended the third stream movement before it came close to catching on beyond academic circles. Since its heyday in the late '50s, there have been occasional third stream projects ranging from significant successes (such as Eddie Daniels' Breakthrough CD for GRP) to some that sound closer to pompous Muzak.

In the best avant-garde performances it is difficult to tell when compositions end and improvisations begin; the goal is to have the solos be an outgrowth of the arrangement. As with free jazz, the avant-garde came of age in the 1960s and has continued almost unnoticed as a menacing force in the jazz underground, scorned by the mainstream that it influences. Among its founders in the mid-to-late '50s were pianist Cecil Taylor, altoist Ornette Coleman and keyboardist-bandleader Sun Ra.

Not all contemporary jazz artists completely discard improvisation and challenging experimentation, but by and large, most instrumentalists emphasize shiny production, melody, and accessibility.

The main difference between bop and swing is that the soloists engaged in chordal (rather than melodic) improvisation, often discarding the melody altogether after the first chorus and using the chords as the basis for the solo. Ensembles tended to be unisons, most jazz groups were under seven pieces, and the soloist was free to get as adventurous as possible as long as the overall improvisation fit into the chord structure. Since the virtuoso musicians were getting away from using the melodies as the basis for their solos (leading some listeners to ask \"Where's the melody?\") and some of the tempos were very fast, bop divorced itself from popular music and a dancing audience, uplifting jazz to an art music but cutting deeply into its potential commercial success. Ironically the once-radical bebop style has become the foundation for all of the innovations that followed and now can be almost thought of as establishment music.

Although swing largely began when Louis Armstrong joined Fletcher Henderson's Orchestra in 1924 and Don Redman began writing arrangements for the band that echoed the cornetist's relaxed phrases, the swing era officially started in 1935 when Benny Goodman's Orchestra caught on. Swing was a major force in American popular music until the big-band era largely ended in 1946. Swing differs from New Orleans jazz and Dixieland in that the ensembles (even for small groups) are simpler and generally filled with repetitious riffs, while in contrast the solos are more sophisticated. Individual improvisations still paid close attention to the melody but due to the advance in musicianship, the solo flights were more adventurous. The swing-oriented musicians who continued performing in the style after the end of the big band era (along with later generations who adopted this approach) were also playing \"mainstream.\" The many stars of swing during the big-band era included trumpeters Louis Armstrong, Bunny Berigan, Harry James, and Roy Eldridge; trombonists Tommy Dorsey and Jack Teagarden; clarinetists Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw; tenor saxophonists Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, and Ben Webster; altoists Johnny Hodges and Benny Carter; pianists Teddy Wilson, Art Tatum, Earl Hines, Count Basie, and Nat King Cole; guitarist Charlie Christian; drummers Gene Krupa and Chick Webb; vibraphonist Lionel Hampton; bandleader Glenn Miller; and singers Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Jimmy Rushing.

By lumping the music of all large jazz bands together, marketers overlook the different kinds of jazz that large groups have performed: swing (Duke Ellington and Count Basie), bebop (Dizzy Gillespie), cool (Gerry Mulligan, Shorty Rogers, Gil Evans), hard bop (Gerald Wilson), free jazz (some of Sun Ra's work after the 1950s), and jazz-rock fusion (Don Ellis' and Maynard Ferguson's groups of the 1970s).

For them, the strategies of arranging and soloing that were established during the 1930s link all large jazz ensembles more than the different rhythmic and harmonic concepts distinguish those of one era, for example bebop, from those of another, for example those of jazz-rock.Another important consideration is that journalists and jazz fans of the 1930s and '40s drew distinctions between bands that conveyed the most hard-driving rhythmic qualities and frequent solo improvisations, and those that conveyed less pronounced swing feeling and improvisation. The former were called \"swing bands\" or \"hot bands\" (e.g., Count Basie's and Duke Ellington's).

Of all European nations, Britain took to Jazz most comfortably, and by the time recordings of British Dance Bands began to become common in 1923, jazz was already a well-established commodity in the U.K. The tremendous success enjoyed by the American group Hal Kemp's Carolina Club Orchestra in 1924 gained the attention of authorities who were concerned about the deleterious effect touring American bands had on local orchestras, so an embargo was set up to keep the American bands out. This was relaxed from time to time to allow a specific American orchestra that the English wanted to hear, for example Duke Ellington, to come to the UK. The effect of the embargo was to encourage the British Dance Band to flourish, and it did not exclude individual Americans from joining local bands. American musicians such as Adrian Rollini, Frank Guerante, and Danny Polo enjoyed celebrity status in the UK upon abandoning their American careers to perform overseas. On the other hand, certain British bandleaders, such as Ambrose, Spike Hughes, Reginald Foresythe, and Ray Noble went to America to form and record with ensembles in the United States.The way that this continuing cross-fertilization between the American model and the British bands played out was that jazz orchestras within the UK grew to be more numerous and of generally higher quality than those in continental European nations at the time. Recordings of jazz groups and dance orchestras such as Ambrose, Lew Stone, Fred Elizalde, the Savoy Orpheans, Jack Harris, and Sid Phillips compare favorably to those made by dance bands in the United States. The British style of swing was basically undistinguishable from the American model, except that it was a bit more polite and less serious, and featured singers that were obviously attuned to the UK style of English speech as opposed to American accents. The interruption of the Second World War meant mostly that the best talent ended up transferred into the military, and some key artists were lost during the London blitz, most tragically the exquisite South African singer Al Bowlly, killed in a bombing raid in 1941.Whereas the American dance band went into a quick decline after the Second World War ended, in the UK they remained popular well into the Rock 'n' Roll era, and have never really gone entirely out of fashion, despite stiff competition over the years from newer developments in English music such as Trad, Skiffle, the more advanced forms of Jazz, Rock music, Punk and Reggae.

Ballroom dances may seem more serious than other forms of dance, and to some extent they are.

Until the development of the waltz, couples were often apart on the dance floor or switched partners in the course of the dance -- even in such renowned forms as the minuet.             "}

However, Celts still live in large numbers in the Brittany region of France and Galicia in Spain and Celtic music has survived in those areas.  The Irish diaspora has also brought Celtic culture to the New World, with unique Celtic music styles arising from places like Cape Breton in Canada.  In the U.S., large Irish settlements in Chicago and Boston produce musicians who play music that at times sounds more traditional than that produced by their fellow musicians in Ireland.Traditional Celtic music is song-based, and ranges from melancholy tales of lost love and heroes to largely instrumental jigs and reels used for dancing. Stringed instruments, hand-held drums like the bodhran, and a variety of pipes and flutes are played by musicians who usually play solo or in small groups.  Modern Celtic music has made a major impact on the New Age genre; its influence on pop and rock is a two-way street, with some modern Celtic bands absorbing the harder-edged sound of rock, while rock bands like the Pogues and the Saw Doctors incorporate Celtic instruments and rhythms into their music.

It is based on interlocking rhythmic and melodic patterns rather than a dense sound where all instruments are played simultaneously. It is connected to a number of Caribbean musical styles such as biguine, merengue, compass direct, cadence, guaguanc\u00f3, and danzon. Like all of these musical styles, in zouk, rhythm is one of the most significant elements. There are many musical influences on zouk, and the differences between borrowed styles are often smoothed over rather than accentuated. Strong beats are reinforced and the syncopated bass pattern, like that of salsa or funk, is not used. The timbre of the music (its color, the different ways music \"sounds\") are a vital element in zouk. By using the technical resources available to musicians today, sound can be manipulated to make the familiar sound new. The sound of the conga may be manipulated electronically to give it a variety of sounds. A drum set may receive the same treatment with some parts of the set being left \"natural\" while others are altered. A basic rule of zouk is to create space in the music by avoiding an overwhelming density of simultaneous parts, allowing the insertion of interesting sounds into the \"holes\" that are created. Zouk instrumentation usually includes a brass section, two synthesizers, guitar, and bass, and a rhythm section that includes a gourd shaker, conga, drum set, and tumba. The bass line is more than a rhythmic or harmonic instrument, having taken on more of a melodic function. Of the two synthesizers, one acts as a percussion instrument, reproducing what the percussion instruments do, while the other inserts melodic lines at strategic locations. The guitar plays melodic riffs (short repeated melodic phrases) rather than strumming chords, and is also used for solos. The brass section plays in unison, rarely soloing, and is sometimes used to set up counterpoint to the main melody.             "}

Originally, bamboo tubes of varying sizes had been used as percussion instruments to accompany vocal songs -- mostly because of restrictions on genuine drums, designed by the white government to curtail the annual Carnival celebrations among the Afro-Caribbean and Indian (true Indian, not native American) population. Metal objects, however, produced much louder, livelier accompaniment, and so industrial leftovers -- various types of pans, containers, and drums (in the \"barrel\" sense of the word) -- became the new instruments of choice. Players learned that different pitches could be drawn from some of the containers, and eventually how to tune the instruments with slight modifications. By the 1940s, steel pan players were crafting instruments that could sound over a dozen pitches. Around 1946-47, steel bands discovered that discarded oil drums -- which were more sturdily constructed -- could be used to fashion excellent instruments, and by the time the '50s rolled around, steel drums made from oil containers boasted different pitches covering full chromatic octaves, plus standard concert-pitch tuning. Technical innovations and refinements continued through the rest of the decade, with ensembles trying to outdo one another at the annual Carnivals. The repertoire of steel bands grew to include not only calypso melodies, but the various styles of music broadcast on the radio -- American jazz, showtunes, and ballroom-dancing music, Latin-American dances, traditional Indian music, and European classical. When college-educated Trinidad & Tobago youth picked up on steel band music in the '50s, it achieved a new respectability among the middle and upper classes, and has remained an important part of the country's -- and the Caribbean's -- musical scene right up to the present day, even if soca has long since eclipsed steel band music in popularity.

The cadence era was exciting and extremely fertile, requiring musicians of only the highest caliber, who could master not only Antilles pop styles like beguine and Creole mazurka, but also those of Haiti and the other neighboring islands. The cadence years saw the evolution of the pop influences that embellish the rootsier foundation of today's Antilles musicians, allowing for expression in an internationally familiar musical language: electric instruments, riffing horn sections, trap set drums, topical lyrics, and specific stylings of rock music, reggae, soca, American black music, and more. In addition to Les Aiglons, this was the heyday of big bands like La Perfecta, Typical Combo, La Selecta, Les Maxels, Les Lopards, Les Vikings de la Guadeloupe (whose co-leader, Pierre-Edouard Decimus, went on to create the group Kassav' at the end of the decade), and Gordon Henderson's Exile One of Dominique. Recordings from this era, while fascinating and enjoyable, often suffer from out-of-tune instruments and subpar recording quality. Cadence led directly into the early '80s and the rise of zouk, and it was the musicians schooled in cadence who were the first zouk stars. The major catalyst behind the emergence of zouk was the desire to produce a new Caribbean music that treated the multifaceted music of the Antilles to the state-of-the-art recording technology of the Paris studios.

The Bahia is loosely called the \"rural samba,\" a generic term for circle dance music of Bantu derivation, of which the samba da roda (\"of the circle\") is a variety. Although often identified with the batuque and probably derived from the music and dancing of candomble, it is somewhat milder in tempo with fewer accents than its prototype. The technique of responsorial singing continues in the rural samba, and syncopation is employed. The in of the Bahian samba occasionally includes instruments a step away from the more African batuque, such as the pandeiro, tamviolao or guitar, a rattle, and at times the berimbau. The Rio de Janeiro variety is called the \"urban samba,\" and it exists in two forms, the samba de morro (\"of the hill\") and the \"downtown samba.\" The former is the genre associated with the inhabitants of the favelas or slums of Rio (located on the hills overlooking the commercial and middle to upper class residential areas), who each year prior to carnival learn the new sambas and marchas (marches) in the escolas de samba (samba schools). During the typical meetings of the escola de samba, a dance and music master teaches the new movements and songs for that year's carnival, while the percussion section provides the dance rhythms.  The melodies are usually sung in unison chorus by all the dancers after the song leader sings a verse (the style is not responsorial). They are strikingly European, or more correctly, Brazilian European, but not African in their contour, although they are syncopated. The rhythms of the percussion, however, are very complex and extremely sonorous with the added use of double bells, rattles, tambourines, and the puita, a friction drum. Many of the other drums are Western military side drums. The samba of the \"elite,\" the so-called downtown samba, is popular music. The songs, sung in unison chorus, are arrangements accompanied by a typical salon orchestra of brasses and reeds, with a trap drummer providing rhythms that only occasionally demonstrate Africanisms. With this type of music, and others like it farther down the African heritage scale, the point is reached where it is nearly impossible to see the derivations.             "}

Compared to the songs of tropicalia musicians, the greatest common bond is in the lyrics, which are well thought out, keyed to musical events of the accompaniment, poetic, elegant, and above all, socially aware. Thus, the works of the major composers in tropicalia, such as Chico Buarque's \"Pedro Pedreiro,\" Caetano Veloso's \"Superbacana,\" and Gilberto Gil's \"Miserere Nobis,\" display a wide range of musical treatment united by an ideology of social criticism and serious artistic treatment of the music and texts.

By the '80s, Kuti's style had been well established, and although the massive scale and distinctive personality of his performances attracted few imitators, he was revered as a legend for his musical virtuosity and political activism. Kuti's Afro-Beat was primarily rooted in West African highlife -- a bright, sunny dance music driven by horns and/or guitars -- but synthesized it with African-American musical forms like funk (particularly that of James Brown) and jazz. The results were intensely rhythmic and emphasized large ensembles, extended grooves, and improvised jams instead of song structure (many of Kuti's albums, in fact, featured pieces that were half an hour in length). Although Afro-Beat was at bottom a dance music, Kuti's performances rarely allowed his audiences to get lost in the grooves -- whether through the flashy choreography of his band and backup singers, the demanding length of his songs, or the frequent political tirades aimed at provoking intellectual response. Following Kuti's death in 1997, his son Femi -- who had often taken over as bandleader during Fela's periodic imprisonments -- picked up the Afro-Beat torch and began a full-fledged career of his own, keeping his father's music alive and proving himself a worthy successor.

Salsa is a term much like the word \"swing\" as it was applied to the jazz swing bands of the 1930s and 1940s. It describes a feeling that covers a wide range of emotions and musical expression. Salsa is not always fast-paced and vivid -- it can be slow and romantic or anything in between. The basic sound of salsa was intact before the term was applied to the music. In the 1940s and '50s, the Cuban sonero Arsenio Rodrigues, a blind tres player, became the dominant trendsetter in Latin music. His ensemble included a piano, a second trumpet, sometimes a saxophone, and an expanded rhythm section that included timbales, conga, and a cowbell. Instrumental parts were standardized and tight pre-set compositions were used. Salsa is also characterized by syncopated bass patterns. The ensembles of Rodrigues became the standard for Cuban dance bands and formed the basis for salsa. Salsa is influenced by many Latin musical forms, like the Puerto Rican plenas, the Dominican merengue, and the Colombian cumbia, but its backbone is the Cuban son. The primary difference between salsa and Cuban music is that salsa has largely developed outside of Cuba. Although salseros are found in most Latin American countries, it is primarily associated with Puerto Rican musicians. The term \"salsa\" did not come into use until the 1960s. It was applied to the music of Tito Puente and others who had been playing the music for at least 25 years. The term was made popular primarily by Jerry Masucci, the New York-based founder of Fania Records (the largest producer of Latin dance music recordings until the 1980s). The best years for salsa were the 1970s, when Latin Americans were looking back to their roots. This showed in the attitude of salsa musicians looking for stylistic purity. They did so by using smaller band sizes like that of the Cuban conjunto, consisting of a rhythm section with a front line of three to five horns and one or two singers. Although salsa is a Cuban-based musical form (and a commercial form as well), it has served as a rallying point for Puerto Ricans and as an icon of pan-Latin consciousness. Nonetheless, salsa is still a form of dance music subject to the whims of public tastes, and it suffered a decline in popularity in the 1980s as the Dominican merengue became fashionable. Salsa survived in all its dynamism but in a more diffuse environment, as other styles of Latin music become popular on a mass level.             "}

In its traditional form -- known as merengue tipico -- merengue was a vocal-driven dance music that reflected the blending of Spanish and African cultural influences. The accordion was used as the lead instrument, and the guitar frequently provided accompaniment; the most important percussion instruments were the tambora drum and guiro (scraper), with the marimba often joining that basic combination. Merengue pieces usually consisted of a paseo (introduction), then a theme introduced by one or two vocalists, and then a more uptempo call-and-response section featuring a vocal soloist and chorus. It was strongly similar to a Haitian dance form referred to as \"m\u00e9ringue,\" and the exact origins are widely debated, with any distinctions largely resting on geographic location. Merengue had been the music of rural peasants until dictator Rafael Trujillo, in deference to his roots in that social class, declared it the official national style in the mid-'30s; its popularity spread rapidly as peasants emigrated to cities and brought the style into urban dance halls, although the upper classes were a bit slower to accept its legitimacy. Over the next three decades, merengue ensembles grew into large orchestras complete with piano, brass, bass, and saxophones; the saxophone gradually supplanted the accordion as the lead instrument of choice. By the 1960s, led by performers like Johnny Ventura, merengue was usually performed in big-band formats very similar to salsa, although merengue's rhythms and accompanying dance movements were not as complex (and, therefore, easier for Latin-dance newcomers to learn). Electric guitars and synthesizers were introduced over the years and became standard instrumentation, rendering the accordion all but extinct as an important part of the music. Merengue's dominant figure in the late '80s and early '90s was African-influenced singer/songwriter Juan Luis Guerra, whose 1990 album Bachata Rosa fused merengue with a similar, guitar-based rural style called bachata, helping bring that music into the Dominican mainstream. Merengue became quite popular outside of the Dominican Republic as well, finding especially strong footholds in Puerto Rico, New York, and Miami.            "}

Compas now had a less direct meaning and became a generic term to refer to the Haitian style or, more specifically, rhythm. As the immigrant community grew, New York City became home to the top compas bands.

It was developed by working-class Mexican-Americans living in Texas -- hence the name, which is the Spanish word for \"Texan\" and became the accepted term for the music in the early '80s. Bandleader Beto Villa was a pivotal figure in the music's birth, adding instrumentation and song structures (i.e. ranchera, cumbia, polka, etc.) from conjunto/norte\u00f1o music to his orchestra, which drew upon a regional synthesis of Mexican folk music and big-band swing. The most important contributor, though, was Isidro L\u00f3pez, who added vocals, mariachi style, and early rock & roll rhythms while aggressively playing up his conjunto influences. The result was a combination of rural folk and urban sophistication that appealed mightily to young Mexican-Americans in search of a music to call their own, just as rock and R&B were taking over other youth markets during the mid-'50s. During the early '60s, the tejano ensemble shrank from a large orchestra to a medium-sized group more reliant on electric instruments, although horn sections and accordions remained important parts of the music. Many of these groups played English-language Top 40 rock & roll covers in addition to their Spanish repertoire. In the early '70s, tejano music (then known as la onda chicana) really came into its own, borrowing freely from other musical traditions present in Texas -- blues, country, R&B, pop, rock, jazz -- and blending them with Mexican folk as it saw fit. The most important artist of this period was Little Joe (aka Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda DeLe\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez) Y La Familia, whose music reflected the emerging political consciousness of disillusioned Chicano youth. During the mid-'70s, tejano lost much of its audience to more traditional Mexican music, but staged a comeback in the mid-'80s thanks to a new infusion of mainstream musical hybrids, as well as major-label interest in the growing Latino market. Bands like Mazz and La Mafia expanded their stage shows to reflect the glitz and excitement of English-language performers, and Selena's pop sensibilities helped make her a superstar in the Latin community. The early '90s saw the greatest creative fertility and diversity of tejano music to date, but just as those qualities were beginning to wane, Selena was murdered in 1995, touching off a mass media explosion that brought tejano to the top of the album charts with her posthumous smash Dreaming of You.

In Texas, norte\u00f1o music is generally referred to as conjunto (after the ensemble that performs it), with the only real differences being location (and corresponding changes in accent), and the preference of norte\u00f1o for the more traditional corrido song form over the ranchera; norte\u00f1o is also very similar to Tejano music, except that its sensibility is more rural and traditional than modern or urban, and its rhythmic drive is somewhat less pronounced. In addition to being primarily dance-oriented, norte\u00f1o has also had a historical role as the music of the working classes, its celebratory exuberance and often tough, rowdy lyrical themes setting it apart. The standard ensemble features an accordion (usually a simple diatonic model), bajo sexto (a baritone-range twelve-string guitar), bass, and drums, along with one or two expressive vocalists. This format solidified around the 1950s, but its roots date back to the late 1800s, when the Mexican population in the area was introduced to the accordion and to various European folk dances -- polkas, waltzes, redovas, mazurkas, schottisches -- by German and Czech immigrants living in southern Texas. Eventually, Mexican musical forms like huapango and cancion ranchera were fused with the European dance rhythms, producing a unique hybrid. The bajo sexto evolved into an important accompaniment for the accordion, especially when accordionist Narciso Martinez discovered in the 1930s that his partner, bajo sexto player Santiago Almeida, could play all of the accordion's bass parts; this freed Martinez to concentrate on virtuosic, upper-register melodic runs, and produced a lighter, cleaner interaction between the two. Santiago Jimenez introduced string bass in 1936, and Valerio Longoria began utilizing trap drums as percussive accompaniment in 1949 (although for a time they were considered too noisy for recording sessions); Longoria also began adding vocals, transforming what had previously been an entirely instrumental music. Norte\u00f1o's popularity exploded in the 1950s, as the border-area population became more urbanized and reached out for familiar comforts in their new surroundings; as the music spread into larger dance halls, electric instruments and amplification followed. Although norte\u00f1o could encompass a variety of song forms and rhythms, its dominant mode of expression was a corrido (story-song) performed over a polka or waltz rhythm. During the 1960s, the virtuosic explorations of el Conjunto Bernal pushed the music's technical demands to new heights, and by the following decade, norte\u00f1o/conjunto was solidly entrenched as the most popular style of music among the Mexican working classes in Texas and northern Mexico. At that point, norte\u00f1o's formal development essentially halted, although performers like Flaco Jimenez flirted with pop accessibility, and others introduced synthesizers to the sound during the 1980s. Thanks to groups like Los Bravos del Norte and Los Tigres del Norte, norte\u00f1o's popularity only continued at the beginning of the new millennium, attracting tremendous attention from Latinos all over America and other parts of Mexico, as well as fans in Europe and Japan.

The origin of the name has been attributed to its being a derivation of the French word \"marriage,\" but it may be a combination of the name \"Maria\" with the Nahuatl diminutive suffix \"chi\" (Nahuatl was an indigenous Indian language widely spoken in the area). The original ensemble consisted of two violins, a vihuela (also known as guitara de golpe -- a regional name for a small guitar with five strings), jarana (a slightly larger five-string guitar), and harp. In the 20th century, guitarron (a large, acoustic bass guitar with four strings) replaced the harp, which was awkward to transport. In the 1930s, two trumpets were added, and the resulting ensemble -- two trumpets, two violins, jarana, vilhuela, and guitarron -- has been popularized through films, radio, TV, and sound recordings.

Because mariachis usually make their living by strolling from place to place in search of good money -- on street corners or restaurants -- their instruments are portable. Mariachis are a common sight in the Zona Rosa and the Plaza Garibaldi in Mexico City.             "}

Cumbia was a synthesis of the traditions of three separate cultures: former slaves of African descent, who contributed the rhythms and percussion instruments; descendants of European colonists, primarily Hispanics, who influenced the music's melodic progressions; and native Americans descended from Andean tribes, who affected cumbia's melodic and harmonic sense and also contributed the flutes on which cumbia was initially played. Additionally, the geographical location of Colombia's northern coast left the area open to influences from the Caribbean, which probably accounts for cumbia's resemblance to other styles from the region; the most notable similarity is its steady backbeat, which is closer to Jamaican popular music than to the fluid, shifting rhythms of Latin jazz and salsa. In its purest, most folk-derived form, cumbia is played on a combination of African drums and native American flutes, but the accordion eventually became the most popular lead instrument; organ and harp have also found favor in some quarters. Cumbia's infectious, highly danceable beat found its way overseas, beginning around the 1960s, and became an indispensable tool for many Latin bands and orchestras; it achieved special popularity in Mexico, where many groups incorporated it into their repertoire of popular songs. The cumbia tradition helped give rise to vallenato, a similar style that became Colombia's signature sound during the late 20th century; the main differences are that vallenato is usually played at a slower tempo, places a great deal more emphasis on the poetry of its lyrics, and draws from several different rhythms instead of one signature beat.

{"title": "Corrido", "url": "https://www.allmusic.com/style/corrido-ma0000011893", "discription": "                The corrido is a popular Mexican song form found in the repertoires of groups who perform in the small-group, folk-based conjunto and norte\u00f1o styles, although it's especially preferred in the latter (other popular song forms in these styles include the ranchera, cumbia, and bolero). Corridos are storytelling ballads (in the folk-music sense of the word) that are usually performed to waltz (or sometimes polka) rhythms, and whose subject matter often (though certainly not exclusively) focuses on heroes and great deeds, usually providing social commentary in the process. The exact details of what constitutes a hero or a great deed have shifted over time along with Mexican culture: when the corrido first became popular in the early part of the 20th century, around the time of the Mexican Revolution, it naturally gravitated toward war heroes. During the middle of the century, corridos tended to glorify rebellious spirits defiant of white America, and became one of the most popular song forms in northern Mexico and among Latinos living in Texas and the American Southwest. That popularity only increased with the advent of the civil rights movement during the '60s, although when that furor died down toward the end of the decade, many American conjunto groups de-emphasized the corrido in their repertoires. During the '70s, however, the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte broke new ground when they began recording corridos dedicated to drug smuggling and illegal border crossings. This approach became wildly popular -- and controversial -- through the '90s, although other groups, Los Tigres included, took a more socially conscious route and addressed political injustice and problems faced by Mexican immigrants to the U.S.            "}
{"title": "Conjunto", "url": "https://www.allmusic.com/style/conjunto-ma0000012339", "discription": "                It may be confusing to the uninitiated that the Spanish word Conjunto translates as \"group,\" because not every band with the word \"conjunto\" in their name actually performs in the specific musical style also known as conjunto. Genuine conjunto is a small-group dance music, driven by accordion and bajo sexto, and is actually native to Texas and northern Mexico. Outside of Texas, conjunto music is generally referred to as \"la musica norte\u00f1a,\" or simply norte\u00f1o, with the only real differences being location and the preference of conjunto for the ranchera song form over the corrido; conjunto is also very similar to Tejano music, except that its sensibility is more rural and traditional than modern or urban. In addition to being primarily dance-oriented, conjunto has also had a historical role as the music of the working classes, its celebratory exuberance and often tough, rowdy lyrical themes setting it apart. The standard conjunto ensemble features an accordion (usually a simple diatonic model), bajo sexto (a baritone-range twelve-string guitar), bass, and drums, along with one or two expressive vocalists. This format solidified around the 1950s, but its roots date back to the late 1800s, when the Mexican population in the area was introduced to the accordion and to various European folk dances -- polkas, waltzes, redovas, mazurkas, schottisches -- by German and Czech immigrants living in southern Texas. Eventually, Mexican musical forms like huapango and cancion ranchera were fused with the European dance rhythms, producing a unique hybrid. The bajo sexto evolved into an important accompaniment for the accordion, especially when accordionist Narciso Martinez discovered in the 1930s that his partner, bajo sexto player Santiago Almeida, could play all of the accordion's bass parts; this freed Martinez to concentrate on virtuosic, upper-register melodic runs, and produced a lighter, cleaner interaction between the two. Santiago Jimenez introduced string bass in 1936, and Valerio Longoria began utilizing trap drums as percussive accompaniment in 1949 (although for a time they were considered too noisy for recording sessions); Longoria also began adding vocals, transforming what had previously been an entirely instrumental music. Conjunto's popularity exploded in the 1950s, as the Mexican-American population became more urbanized and reached out for familiar comforts in their new surroundings; as the music spread into larger dance halls, electric instruments and amplification followed. Although conjunto could encompass a variety of song forms and rhythms, its dominant mode of expression was a ranchera performed over a polka or waltz rhythm. During the 1960s, the virtuosic explorations of El Conjunto Bernal pushed the music's technical demands to new heights, and by the following decade, conjunto was solidly entrenched as the most popular style of music among the Mexican working classes in Texas and northern Mexico. At that point, conjunto's formal development essentially halted, although performers like Flaco Jimenez flirted with pop accessibility, and others introduced synthesizers to the sound during the 1980s. However, conjunto's popularity has only continued to spread through the '90s, attracting tremendous attention from Latinos all over America and other parts of Mexico, as well as fans in Europe and Japan.

The style's practitioners, called trovadores, lived very much like medieval troubadours, traveling the country and supporting themselves with the meager monetary rewards that came from performing. Trova music actually encompassed a variety of native Cuban song forms and rhythms, including the guaracha, the punto, the habanera, the rumba, the son, the clave, and the Latin American bolero, as well as a melodic influence from European opera. These songs were initially performed with guitar (and, usually, clav\u00e9) accompaniment and one or two vocalists, a format which became popular in Santiago and other eastern towns. Income-seeking trovadores found their way to Havana and worked as street performers, spreading the style to audiences who began to think of it as the sound of their nation. The four most important early trovadores were Sindo Garay, Rosendo Ruiz [Suarez], Alberto Villalon [Morales], and Manuel Corona [Raimundo]. These and other trova performers, like Maria Teresa Vera, made their first recordings during the 1910s, both in Havana and New York City. During the '20s, the son form became wildly popular and tended to dominate the other, more traditional components of trova; it provided a great deal of exposure for most of the original trova singers and gave rise to the popular sexteto group format. However, six-member bands cost more to book, which led to a return to trova's early trio format (\"trio\" referring more to the three essential parts of the song -- two voices and guitar accompaniment -- than the specific number of group members, which varied according to whether the vocalists could play guitar or percussion while singing). However, these arrangements were more elaborate, often including a second guitar and extra percussion (the latter to emphasize the music's increasing dance orientation). The '30s brought an unprecedented level of popularity for Cuban music, with the crossover success of \"The Peanut Vendor\" (\"El Manisero\") in the U.S. and the bolero song form in Mexico, and while traditional trova compositions were still very much in evidence, new musical innovations and commercial considerations contributed to trova's gradual decline and near-disappearance over the next two decades. However, Castro's government encouraged the revival of traditional Cuban music, subsidizing the creation of an ambitious, folk-based form known as nueva trova, which drew heavily from trova while updating and expanding its sensibilities.

Puerto Rican salsa had developed into an eclectic blend of Latin American roots styles during the '60s, and the strong Puerto Rican presence in New York City meant that the music was readily available. While the New York salseros were somewhat influenced by Latin jazz and the mambo orchestras of the '40s and '50s, salsa was really about consciously returning to traditional Afro-Latin forms, and finding new ways to unite and blend them. To a certain extent, this was a specific reaction against the pop orientation of boogaloo and the crossover rock of Santana, but more importantly, it was a part of the generalized artistic intent that had overtaken much American music -- including rock and jazz -- during the '60s. The flagship label of New York salsa was the highly prolific Fania, founded by multi-instrumentalist Johnny Pacheco with Jerry Masucci; Fania helped create a strong, collaborative community of New York salsa musicians, partly through projects like the Fania All-Stars, which featured dozens of top players and actually headlined a concert at Yankee Stadium in 1973. Other major figures in the New York salsa movement included trombonist Willie Col\u00f3n, percussion veteran Ray Barretto, singer Rub\u00e9n Blades, pianist Joe Bataan, and Latin-jazz pianist Eddie Palmieri.

{"title": "Latin Pop", "url": "https://www.allmusic.com/style/latin-pop-ma0000004461", "discription": "                Latin Pop became the most popular form of Latin music in the United States during the '80s and '90s, even achieving massive crossover success among non-Latino listeners during the late '90s. While not restricted to America by any means, Latin pop was profoundly affected by production techniques and other styles of music -- both Latin and otherwise -- that originated primarily in the United States. Tejano music, centered in Texas and the U.S./Mexico border region, had begun to introduce synthesizers, slicker production, and a more urban sensibility to formerly rootsy styles like norte\u00f1o and conjunto. Moreover, New York and Miami were home to thriving Latin club scenes, which during the '80s led to the rise of Latin freestyle, a club-oriented dance music that was rooted in Latin rhythms but relied on synthesizers and drum machines for most of its arrangements. Both of these sounds influenced the rise of Latin pop, which retained Latin rhythms in its uptempo numbers but relied more on mainstream pop for its melodic sense. Latin pop's first major crossover star was Gloria Estefan, who scored a succession of non-club-oriented dance-pop hits during the mid- to late '80s, but who eventually became known more as an adult contemporary diva with an affinity for sweeping ballads. This blend of Latinized dance-pop and adult contemporary balladeering dominated Latin pop through the '90s; most of its artists sang in Spanish for Latino audiences, although Latin pop's similarity to the mainstream helped several performers score crossover hits when they chose to record in English. Jon Secada landed several pop hits during the mid-'90s, and Tejano pop star Selena's album Dreaming of You actually debuted at number one on the album charts upon its 1995 release (although, sadly, her success was posthumous). However, that was nothing compared to Latin pop's commercial explosion in 1999, thanks to well-crafted, mostly English-language crossover albums by ex-Menudo member Ricky Martin (already a star among Spanish-speaking audiences) and actress Jennifer Lopez.

In 1963, two Top 20 breakout hits -- \"Watermelon Man\" by Mongo Santamaria and \"El Watusi\" by Ray Barretto -- helped birth the boogaloo. Soon, dozens of groups were playing the same infectious rhythms, usually featuring novelty songs in English, group vocals, and fierce conga playing. Latin veterans like Tito Puente andPerez Prado did boogaloos as well, and young (often teenaged) artists like Joe Bataan, Pucho & His Latin Soul Brothers, the Latinaires, the Latin Souls, and the Lat-Teens burst onto the scene. Still, very few artists devoted an entire album to the boogaloo, since the sound was so catchy as to be practically played out after just one or two songs.

Couples can still dance to its sensuous beat, but the bolero is most often described as the Latin equivalent of a torch song. Bolero, in its Latin American form, first appeared in the Cuban city of Santiago around the end of the 19th century; the legendary vocalist Beny Mor\u00e9 did much to spread bolero's popularity around the rest of Latin America during the '40s and '50s. The music took especially strong root in Mexico, where most norte\u00f1o and mariachi groups still devote at least some portion of their repertoires to the style.

Son was essentially a marriage of syncopated African rhythms and percussion with trova's Spanish-derived melodies and string instruments. The music and its accompanying dance moves developed in eastern Cuba, particularly the Oriente province, around the beginning of the 20th century, and by the end of World War I, son had become quite popular in Havana despite its lower-class, multi-ethnic origins. In its most commonly accepted form, son was performed by a septet featuring trumpet, guitar, bass, tres (a nine-string guitar-like instrument), bongos, maracas, and the all-important time-keeping clav\u00e9s; usually, at least one or two of the musicians doubled as vocalists. The clav\u00e9 pattern of the son form typically covered two measures of four beats apiece, striking three times during the first measure and twice in the second (or, sometimes, vice versa). As son's popularity grew among higher social classes during the '30s, musicians began to move toward a more smoothed-out, genteel sound; around the same time, composer Mois\u00e9s Sim\u00f3ns scored a huge international hit with his son \"El Manisero\" (\"The Peanut Vendor\"), igniting a passion in the United States for Afro-Cuban dance music. (Much of what Americans referred to as \"rumba\" during this time was actually son.) In the early '40s, son bandleader and tres player Arsenio Rodriguez invented a variation on the form called the son montu\u00f1o, which often reversed the typical clav\u00e9 pattern, was taken at a slightly more deliberate tempo, and (similar to the guaracha) added a section called the montu\u00f1o, which featured call-and-response improvisation by the lead vocalist over a chorus vamp (plus, sometimes, instrumental solos). The spontaneity of son montu\u00f1o renewed the spark of the original form, and laid the groundwork for the mambo explosion that was to come shortly; it was also a central component of both Afro-Cuban jazz and salsa. Although son is rarely performed exclusively anymore, it remains a strongly rooted tradition that Latin musicians still look to in order to refresh and renew their music.            "}

When Prohibition made it illegal to sell alcohol in the United States, the American mob journeyed south to Cuba to set up smuggling operations and tourist outlets like nightclubs, hotels and casinos. Supported by General Machada, \"The President of a Thousand Murders,\" the area around Havana became home to world-famous clubs like the Tropicana and became a major destination for wealthy Americans seeking to escape the austere pallor that had descended back home. The resulting influx of visitors from the U.S. helped create fervent cravings for Cuban music in the States when the tourists returned home with heads full of vibrant Latin sounds. The New York nightclubs and Hollywood movie producers who capitalized on this trend, however were scared away by the dark-skinned players and complex rhythms of the authentic son and rumba bands from the island, and instead promoted a kind of big-band hybrid which was introduced by musicians like Los Angeles-based Xavier Cugat. This music, while sharing a nearly identical name with rumba, had little in common with the music that had originated in the black neighborhoods of Havana and other cities. The name rhumba was effective in conjuring up exotic and exuberant images to market to American audiences, even though authentic rumba was also going through changes at this time as a new generation of musicians adopted western instruments like the piano and upright bass in an effort to sound less folky and ethnic. The name was broadly applied, with many of rhumba's original hits, like Don Azpiazu's arrangement of Moises Sim\u00f3n's \"El Manciero\" actually being son songs. The rhythms of folk music provided rhumba a jumping-off point, but Cugat's pan-Latin influences and the swing bands of New York helped give it a rapidly evolving sound that nearly immediately became a worldwide craze. Havana became known as a cultural center, but many of the bands there knew where the money was coming from and gave themselves English names like Happy Happy and Swing Havana to increase their commercial appeal. Both Miami and New York became centers of the rhumba craze -- with New York rhumba taking cues from big bands and bandleaders in Miami like Desi Arnaz importing new elements like conga drums and carneval-style line dances (the traditional rumba dances were thought to be too hard for non-Cubans to learn) to create dance music that was even more infectious and uncomplicated than rhumba had been. By the late '40s, most rhumba music had picked up the conga drums and line dances of the Miami style and began to be known as \"conga\" instead. However, until the ubiquitous term, \"salsa\" began to be applied to nearly all big-band Latin music in the '70s, the term rhumba was used generically to identify nearly all music from Cuba.

The differences between prog-rock and art rock are often slight in practice, but do exist. Prog-rock tends to be more traditionally melodic (even when multi-sectioned compositions replace normal song structures), more literary (poetry or sci-fi/fantasy novels), and more oriented toward classically trained instrumental technique (with the exception of Pink Floyd). Art rock is more likely to have experimental or avant-garde influences, placing novel sonic texture above prog-rock's symphonic ambitions. Both styles are intrinsically album-based, taking advantage of the format's capacity for longer, more complex compositions and extended instrumental explorations. In fact, many prog bands were fond of crafting concept albums that made unified statements, usually telling an epic story or tackling a grand overarching theme. In addition to pushing rock's technical and compositional boundaries, prog-rock was also arguably the first arena where synthesizers and electronic textures became indispensable parts of a rock ensemble. The earliest rumblings of progressive and art rock could be heard in the poetry of Bob Dylan and conceptually unified albums like the Mothers of Invention's Freak Out! and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, all of which suggested that rock was more than just teenagers' music and should be taken seriously as an art form. Prog-rock began to emerge out of the British psychedelic scene in 1967, specifically a strain of classical/symphonic rock led by the Nice, Procol Harum, and the Moody Blues (Days of Future Passed). King Crimson's 1969 debut In the Court of the Crimson King firmly established the concept of progressive rock, and a quirky, eclectic scene was taking shape in Canterbury, led by the jazzy psychedelia of the Soft Machine. Prog-rock became a commercial force in the early '70s, with Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Yes, Jethro Tull, Genesis, and Pink Floyd leading the way. Meanwhile, a more avant-garde scene (dubbed Kraut-rock) was developing in Germany, and eccentric, unclassifiable bands continued to emerge in the U.K. By the mid-'70s, a backlash was beginning to set in; prog-rock sometimes mistook bombast for majesty, and its far-reaching ambition and concern with artistic legitimacy could make for overblown, pretentious music. Its heyday soon came to an end with the advent of punk, which explicitly repudiated prog's excesses and aimed to return rock & roll to its immediate, visceral roots. Still, prog-rock didn't completely go away. A number of AOR bands used prog ideas in more concise songs; plus, Pink Floyd, Yes, and Genesis all had number one singles in the '80s by retooling their approaches. A small cult of neo-prog bands catered to faithful audiences who still liked grandiose concepts and flashy technique; the first was Marillion, and many more popped up in the late '80s and early '90s.

Noise-rock, like its forerunner no wave, aims to be more abrasive, sometimes for comic effect and sometimes to make a statement, but always concentrating on the sheer power of the sound. While most noise-rock bands concentrate on the ear-shattering sounds that can be produced by distorted electric guitars, some also use electronic instrumentation, whether as percussion or to add to the overall cacophony. Some groups are more concerned than others about integrating their sonic explorations into song structures; pioneers Sonic Youth helped bring noise-rock to a wider alternative-rock audience when they began to incorporate melody into their droning sheets of sound. Sonic Youth produced a bevy of imitators, but not all noise-rock resembles their music -- '80s bands like the Swans and Big Black took a much darker, more threatening approach, and the Touch & Go label became a center for crazed, shock-oriented takes on the style in the late '80s and '90s. A certain theatrical sub-style of  noise-rock, often described as \"scuzz-rock\" or with similar terms, uses the guitar noise to help create a dirty, decadent, repulsive atmosphere (bands like this include Royal Trux, Pussy Galore, the Dwarves, and the Butthole Surfers).

The premier band of the genre was Marillion, who went from lengthy club tours to the top of the charts within a few years and dropped from popular favor almost as fast. Neo-Prog bands are generally influenced by early Genesis, Camel, and to a lesser extent, Van der Graf Generator and Pink Floyd. The music holds a much more lush sound than general rock, but lacks the sophistication of truly symphonic progressive bands like Yes or Camel. Instrumentally, the bands tend to be characterized by a \"noodling\" approach that focuses on dynamic solos, and at its best, neo-prog lyrics are deep, insightful, and acerbic. Whether neo-prog is diluted progressive or adventurous pop depends on the point of view of the listener -- most progressive rock listeners are likely to find the genre dull and unchallenging, while fans of AOR will find the mix more interesting than most rock bands. Although all of the major bands are still producing albums, the classic era of neo-prog effectively ended when vocalist Fish left Marillion in 1987.            "}

Instead of following in the direction of their British and American counterparts, who were moving toward jazz and classical-based compositions and concept albums, the German bands became more mechanical and electronic. Working with early synthesizers and splicing together seemingly unconnected reels of tape, bands like Faust, Can, and Neu created a droning, pulsating sound that owed more to the avant garde than to rock & roll. Although the bands didn't make much of an impact while they were active in the '70s, their music anticipated much post-punk of the early '80s, particularly industrial rock.

Though the direct musical similarities between Canterbury's major bands -- the Soft Machine, Caravan, Gong, Robert Wyatt, Kevin Ayers, Hatfield & the North, Egg, National Health -- aren't overwhelming, each featured a clever synthesis of jazz improvisation and rock rhythms with clever, intellectual songwriting tied to psychedelia. It's no wonder the Canterbury bands became so close, since many of its major figures began their musical careers in a beat group called the Wilde Flowers. Together from 1963 to 1969, the Wilde Flowers included most of the figures who later formed Canterbury's two best bands, the Soft Machine (Robert Wyatt, Kevin Ayers) and Caravan (Pye Hastings, David Sinclair, Richard Sinclair, Richard Coughlan). After both the Soft Machine and Caravan released their debut albums in 1968, they became popular in England's psychedelic underground. By the early '70s however, a series of fragmenting lineup changes and the subsequent formation of new bands soon multiplied the force of the Canterbury scene. Early Soft Machine member Daevid Allen formed Gong, and both Kevin Ayers and Robert Wyatt eventually left the Softs to begin their own solo careers. The musicians that led the new incarnation of the Soft Machine, including Elton Dean and Hugh Hopper, began pushing the band in the direction of instrumental jazz-rock. By the mid-'70s, many of the remaining Canterbury bands had progressed from psychedelic and prog-rock to embrace extended fusion jams with few lyrics. Many of Britain's better avant-garde or fusion musicians of the 1970s and '80s -- including Fred Frith, Allan Holdsworth, and Peter Blegvad -- also began their career playing in Canterbury bands.

The latter, with groups like Egg, Soft Machine, Caravan, and Hatfield & the North (all based in or around the town of Canterbury, England), favored complex compositions bridging classical, rock and jazz idioms, often wrapped in a very British sense of humor that eschewed the typical science-fiction/mystical themes of mainstream prog rock. RIO was a semi-organized movement of the late 1970s regrouping the rock-based avant-garde groups Henry Cow, Etron Fou Leloublan, Univers Zero, Samla Mammas Manna, and Stormy Six.RIO is a term restricted to temporal limits; Canterbury prog to geographical limits. The late 1970s onward saw the development of an avant-prog scene often functioning in the margin of mainstream prog. A host of groups and artists mainly from the USA, but also from Europe and Japan, started to write mostly short instrumental pieces that focused on complexity and stripped down instrumentation, while avoiding the pomposity and stage props of the big prog acts. Some groups (Thinking Plague and the Motor Totemist Guild, for instance) kept working with epic durations and rich instrumentation but also forayed into free improvisation, sound collage, and other avant-garde techniques. These artists found homes in record labels such as Cuneiform (USA), Recommended (later ReR Megacorp, England) and Rec Rec (Switzerland).

Twee pop traces its origins to 1986, the year the British weekly NME issued a cassette dubbed C-86, which included a number of bands -- McCarthy, the Wedding Present, Primal Scream, the Pastels, and the Bodines among them -- influenced in equal measure by the jangly guitar pop of the Smiths, the three-chord naivete of the Ramones, and the nostalgic sweetness of the girl group era. Also dubbed \"anorak pop\" and \"shambling\" by the British press, the C-86 movement was itself short-lived, but it influenced hordes of upcoming bands on both sides of the Atlantic who absorbed the scene's key lessons of simplicity and honesty to stunning effect, resulting in music -- given the universal label of twee pop -- whose hallmarks included boy-girl harmonies, lovelorn lyrics, infectious melodies, and simple, unaffected performances. In the U.K., the hub of the twee-pop scene was for many years the now-legendary Sarah label, home of groups including the Field Mice, Heavenly, and the Orchids; upon Sarah's demise, its founders created a new label, Shinkansen.

As time wore on, the hardcore influences eventually mutated into heavy metal, much like hardcore punk itself. Eventually, the third wave of ska revivalists broke into the American mainstream, thanks to the success of fellow Californian punk revivalists Green Day and the Offspring. The first third wave band to break big was Rancid, but they were quickly followed by groups like No Doubt, Goldfinger, Sublime, and Dancehall Crashers; the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, who were one of the leading figures of the scene in the early '90s, just missed the commercial bandwagon. Most of the bands that followed Rancid into the charts emphasized metal over ska, but some -- like No Doubt -- drew from new wave pop roots as well, while Rancid themselves managed to stay true to both ska revival and punk.

Today, however, space rock refers to a new generation of alternative/indie bands that draw from psychedelic rock, ambient music, and -- more often than not -- experimental and avant-garde influences. Space rock is nearly always slow, hypnotic, and otherworldly; it typically favors lengthy, mind-bending sonic explorations over conventional song structures, and vocals sometimes play second fiddle to the shimmering instrumental textures. Some space rock groups are explicitly drug-inspired, which makes sense given the typically narcotic effect of the style's foundation: washes of heavily reverbed guitar, minimal drumming, and gentle, languid vocals. Space rock's most obvious antecedent was, of course, prog-rock, but in its latter-day incarnation, it was also inspired by Krautrock, classical minimalism, and the noise-pop of the Jesus & Mary Chain. The first of the new space rock bands was Britain's drone-heavy, ultra-minimalist Spacemen 3, whose notorious \"taking drugs to make music to take drugs to\" credo subsequently influenced most of the like-minded bands in their wake. A few of the bands involved in Britain's shoegazer movement had ties to space rock, particularly the early work of the Verve, and the most experimental bands -- like My Bloody Valentine -- went on to influence the space rock revival. In 1991, Spacemen 3 split into two groups, Spectrum and Spiritualized; the latter took the opposite musical approach from its parent group, fleshing out the space rock sound into lush, caressing, orchestrated epics that made them arguably the style's most popular band. Most subsequent space rockers took either the minimalist or maximalist approach, occasionally mixing in elements of post-rock (Flying Saucer Attack, Godspeed You Black Emperor!) or indie pop (Quickspace).

In keeping with the fiercely anti-corporate, anti-authoritarian attitudes of the fans, most skatepunk bands are signed to independent labels, and most prefer to keep it that way as a statement of principle.

Though initial bands began appearing around this time, it wasn\u2019t until the late \u201890s/ early 2000s that many had entered mainstream consciousness. Some of these early bands included Saetia and City of Caterpillar, but screamo was made drastically more popular by later bands like Thursday, the Used, Glassjaw, Thrice, Poison the Well, and MTV favorites, Story of the Year and Hawthorne Heights. Many of these bands took influence from the likes of Refused and At the Drive-In, and subsequent upstarts found their voice listening to albums like Thursday\u2019s Full Collapse, Poison the Well\u2019s The Opposite of December, and Thrice\u2019s The Illusion of Safety.By the turn of the millennium, the music was generally based in the aggressive side of the overarching punk-revival scene (including pop-punk and punk metal), though some alternative metal groups could also be included. Even bands that weren\u2019t necessarily screamo (since the tag can sometimes be vague) would often delve into the genre\u2019s characteristic guttural vocal style not so dissimilar from the abrasive nature of hardcore. It came to be that the soft/loud dynamic of having either one or two singers who alternate between passionate singing and distraught shrieking that characterizes most screamo. These vocals are often layered or appear side-by-side amid aggressive, hard-hitting guitar licks used to trigger an exhaustive, emotional catharsis. Though the music is outwardly tough and powerful, the lyrics are usually of the introspective kind found in softer emo bands. For many groups, like Senses Fail and Vendetta Red, lyrics often boasted violent or bloody imagery alongside subject matter dealing with overwhelming angst and relationships.

Riot grrrl was a blend of personal catharsis and political activism, though most of the attention it drew was due to the latter. Many (but not all) riot grrrl lyrics addressed gender-related issues -- rape, domestic abuse, sexuality (including lesbianism), male dominance of the social hierarchy, female empowerment -- from a radical, militant point of view. The similarly confrontational music favored raging, willfully amateurish blasts of noise, with only a rudimentary sense of melody or instrumental technique. Riot grrrl's abrasiveness served several purposes: it ensured that the anti-corporate music would never achieve alternative rock's crossover success (the label that released the highest percentage of riot grrrl records was called Kill Rock Stars); it defied stereotypes of women (and female musicians) as meek, overly sensitive, and lovelorn; and it found a powerful expressive tool in noise. To most riot grrrl bands, the simple act of picking up a guitar and bashing out a screeching racket was not only fun, but an act of liberation. To outsiders, the musical merits of riot grrrl could be highly variable, but to fans, what the movement represented was arguably even more important than the music. The riot grrrl movement was mostly centered in the Seattle/Olympia, Washington area; several exceptions included England's Huggy Bear, as well as several grungier groups like Babes in Toyland and L7, who fit the spirit of the style but were more tangentially related to its ideology. It was mostly rooted in punk's DIY ethos and tradition of protest, but in terms of direct inspirations, Joan Jett was lionized in many quarters of the movement for her simple, punky hard rock, confident sexuality, and independent business sense. Riot grrrl's emergence coincided with an explosion of female talent in other wings of alternative rock, and the term was frequently misapplied in media accounts of the phenomenon, which incorrectly labeled more accessible alt-rockers like Hole and PJ Harvey as riot grrrls. True riot grrrl bands -- Bratmobile, 7 Year Bitch, the queercore outfit Team Dresch, and the center of the riot grrrl universe, Kathleen Hanna's Bikini Kill -- never even approached popular acceptance. Since most bands weren't very prolific, the movement's initial flash of enthusiasm faded after a few years, but it continued to enjoy a lasting impact in indie culture, where the original bands helped inspire countless feminist zines and were still looked up to as icons and role models. Kathleen Hanna continued to record with several different projects, and scene veterans Sleater-Kinney became critically revered indie stars several years later, thanks to their ability to blend riot grrrl's passion and ideals with hookier songs and intricate instrumental technique.

Essentially, Punk Revival bands were all traditionalists -- they kept alive the sounds and styles of groups like the Sex Pistols, the Stooges, the Jam, the Exploited, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, the Descendents, and countless other punk and hardcore bands. Since hardcore mutated into speed metal in the late '80s, it wasn't surprising that these punk traditionalists were heavier than their initial influences, but that is partially what made the music appealing to a mass audience in America -- it was simpler and heavier, much like a faster, harder outgrowth of grunge rock. The first punk revivalists to break into the American mainstream were Green Day and the Offspring, and their success helped solidify cult followings for groups like Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise, and Pansy Division, as well as bring the spotlight to neglected '80s punk bands like Bad Religion and underground punk genres like the third wave of ska revival.

Post-rock brought together a host of mostly experimental genres -- Kraut-rock, ambient, prog-rock, space rock, math rock, tape music, minimalist classical, British IDM, jazz (both avant-garde and cool), and dub reggae, to name the most prevalent -- with results that were largely based in rock, but didn't rock per se. Post-rock was hypnotic and often droning (especially the guitar-oriented bands), and the brighter-sounding groups were still cool and cerebral -- overall, the antithesis of rock's visceral power. In fact, post-rock was something of a reaction against rock, particularly the mainstream's co-opting of alternative rock; much post-rock was united by a sense that rock & roll had lost its capacity for real rebellion, that it would never break away from tired formulas or empty, macho posturing. Thus, post-rock rejected (or subverted) any elements it associated with rock tradition. It was far more concerned with pure sound and texture than melodic hooks or song structure; it was also usually instrumental, and if it did employ vocals, they were often incidental to the overall effect. The musical foundation for post-rock crystallized in 1991, with the release of two very different landmarks: Talk Talk's Laughing Stock and Slint's Spiderland. Laughing Stock was the culmination of Talk Talk's move away from synth-pop toward a moody, delicate fusion of ambient, jazz, and minimalist chamber music; Spiderland, meanwhile, was full of deliberate, bass-driven grooves, mumbled poetry, oblique structures, and extreme volume shifts. While those two albums would influence many future post-rock bands, the term itself didn't appear until critic Simon Reynolds coined it as a way to describe the Talk Talk-inspired ambient experiments of Bark Psychosis. The term was later applied to everything from unclassifiable iconoclasts (Gastr del Sol, Cul de Sac, Main) to more tuneful indie-rock experimenters like Stereolab, Laika, and the Sea and Cake (not to mention a raft of Slint imitators). Post-rock came into its own as a recognizable trend with the Chicago band Tortoise's second album, 1996's Millions Now Living Will Never Die, perhaps the farthest-reaching fusion of post-rock's myriad touchstones. Suddenly there was a way for critics to classify artists as diverse as Labradford, Trans Am, Ui, Flying Saucer Attack, Mogwai, Jim O'Rourke, and their predecessors (though most hated the label). Post-rock quickly became an accepted, challenging cousin of indie rock, centered around the Thrill Jockey, Kranky, Drag City, and Too Pure labels. Ironically, by the end of the decade, post-rock had itself acquired a reputation for sameness; some found the style's dispassionate intellectuality boring, while others felt that its formerly radical fusions had become predictable, partly because many artists were offering only slight variations on their original ideas. However, even as the backlash set in, a newer wave of bands (the Dirty Three, Rachel's, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Sigur R\u00f3s) gained wider recognition for their distinctive sounds, suggesting that the style wasn't exhausted after all.

These newer bands, termed post-hardcore, often found complex and dynamic ways of blowing off steam that generally went outside the strict hardcore realm of \"loud fast rules.\" These bands often used more than three chords and they also creatively built and released tension rather than airing their dirty laundry in short, sharp, frenetic bursts. Additionally, many of these bands' vocalists were just as likely to deliver their lyrics with a whispered croon as they were a maniacal yelp. Another important influence on many of these bands was U.K. post-punk from the late '70s and early '80s; Gang of Four, Public Image Limited, Joy Division, and Wire played a significant role in many of the bands' musical growth. Some post-hardcore bands, like Fugazi and Quicksand, had roots in the beginnings of hardcore punk and were able to broaden their sound as they became more skilled musicians. Younger bands flowered into post-hardcore after cutting their teeth in high school punk bands. Chicago and Washington, D.C. were particularly fertile areas for this style, which has extended into the late 2000s.            "}

There were a number of accomplished artists -- such as Brian Setzer and the Squirrel Nut Zippers -- within the scene, but generally, retro swing was played by twentysomethings -- children of alternative rock who found that they favored martinis and Sinatra to dope and grunge. Certainly, the scene was tangentially related to the lounge hipsters in indie rock, those fans that rediscovered Esquivel and assembled groups that played lazily swinging easy listening. However, retro swingers weren't really an elitist pack. They made good-time party music, designed for dancing and fun. At first, the scene was concentrated in Los Angeles, but Doug Liman's 1996 film Swingers, which featured Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, brought it into the mainstream, and soon afterward, a deluge of retro swing bands were appearing on major and indie labels. Some had been doing it for a while -- veterans included BBVD, Cherry Poppin' Daddies, the Squirrel Nut Zippers and, Brian Setzer, who pioneered the whole sound in the early '90s with his big band, the Brian Setzer Orchestra. Others were fresh-faced kids, swooning over the legacy of the Rat Pack, while borrowing ideas and songs from Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive. It was a self-conscious hybrid and most bands certainly couldn't play as well as the first-wave swingers they were emulating -- as a matter of fact, soloing hardly even mattered in retro swing -- it was the overall feel and groove that counted.

But shoegaze wasn't about visuals -- it was about pure sound. The sound of the music was overwhelmingly loud, with long, droning riffs, waves of distortion, and cascades of feedback. Vocals and melodies disappeared into the walls of guitars, creating a wash of sound where no instrument was distinguishable from the other. Most shoegaze groups worked off the template My Bloody Valentine established with their early EPs and their first full-length album, Isn't Anything, but Dinosaur Jr., the Jesus & Mary Chain, and the Cocteau Twins were also major influences. Bands that followed -- most notably Ride, Lush, Chapterhouse, and the Boo Radleys -- added their own stylistic flourishes. Ride veered close to '60s psychedelia, while Lush alternated between straight pop and the dream pop of the Cocteau Twins. Almost none of the shoegazers were dynamic performers or interesting interviews, which prevented them from breaking through into the crucial U.S. market. In 1992 -- after the groups had dominated the British music press and indie charts for about three years -- the shoegaze groups were swept aside by the twin tides of American grunge and Suede, the band to initiate the wave of Britpop that ruled British music during the mid-'90s. Some shoegazers broke up within a few years (Chapterhouse, Ride), while other groups -- such as the Boo Radleys and Lush -- evolved with the times and were able to sustain careers into the late '90s.

It occupies the halfway point between bubblegum and the avant-garde, a collision between conventional pop songcraft and the sonic assault of white noise. Noise pop often has a hazy, narcotic feel, as melodies drift through the swirling guitar textures. But it can also be bright and lively, or angular and challenging. Noise pop's earliest roots lie in the Velvet Underground's experiments with feedback, distortion, and drones. Its most recognizable forebears, however, are American alternative rock bands like Sonic Youth and Dinosaur Jr., who wedded rock song structures to thick sheets of guitar distortion. The first proper noise pop band was the Jesus & Mary Chain, whose groundbreaking 1986 debut Psychocandy pretty much birthed the style. Yo La Tengo, perhaps the most prolific and long-lived noise-pop band, debuted around the same time. In the late '80s, noise pop was the chief inspiration for the British shoegazing movement, which made the lyrics more introspective and the melodies more fragile.

The major difference is that while the Seattle bands were firmly rooted in underground alternative rock of the '80s, post-grunge was influenced by what grunge became -- a wildly popular form of inward-looking, serious-minded hard rock. That meant many post-grunge groups imitated the sound and style of grunge, but not necessarily the individual idiosyncracies of its original artists. The angst-ridden, sober introspection typically associated with grunge became virtual requirements in the hands of post-grunge, which tended to view it as a path to artistic legitimacy. In its worst excesses, post-grunge took itself extremely seriously, and was highly self-conscious about its own significance; as a result, grunge's most personal aspects essentially became components of a formula for making grand musical statements. That wasn't universally true, of course, but post-grunge did help codify what was expected of mature, mainstream hard rockers for the rest of the '90s. And despite its alternative roots, post-grunge was definitely a mainstream, commercial style -- it was released on major labels, and its thick, distorted grunge guitars were given a polished, radio-ready production. Yet while much post-grunge is similar, it isn't identical; in addition to grunge, post-grunge bands might draw from early-'80s jangle pop, punk-pop, ska revival, alternative metal, or classic album rock. Plus, a few quirky post-grunge outfits succeeded because of their wiseass senses of humor, rather than the style's typically dour melancholy. After grunge's breakthrough, it didn't take long for post-grunge to appear; bands like Bush and Candlebox became huge successes just a couple years after Nirvana topped the charts at the beginning of 1992. After grunge's initial heyday had passed, post-grunge kept going strong, with a new wave of bands appearing in the mid- to late '90s; some were able to maintain their popularity from one album to the next, while others wound up as one-hit wonders. At the turn of the millennium, post-grunge was still a popular style, and Creed and Matchbox 20 were two of the biggest-selling rock bands in the U.S.            "}

Whether they played trippy psychedelic pop (\u00e0 la the Beatles, early Pink Floyd, and countless others), jangly Byrds-influenced guitar rock, distortion-drenched free-form jams, or mind-bending sonic experiments, these groups looked to psychedelia as a wellspring of evocative, unusual sounds, and either updated or unabashedly copied the original artists' approaches. Some neo-psychedelia was explicitly druggy, while for others it was simply a logical complement to their bizarre lyrics or left-of-center outlooks. Neo-psychedelia has occasionally hit the pop mainstream -- Prince's mid-'80s work, for example, and some of Lenny Kravitz's retro-worshipping output in the '90s. But for the most part, it has been chiefly the domain of alternative and indie-rock bands. Neo-psychedelia first appeared on the British post-punk scene at the end of the '70s, with major figures including the Teardrop Explodes, Echo & the Bunnymen, and the Soft Boys. Aside from the early-'80s Paisley Underground movement and the Elephant 6 collective of the late '90s, most subsequent neo-psychedelia came from isolated eccentrics and revivalists, not cohesive scenes. Some of the biggest included the jangly, dreamy Australian band the Church; Nick Saloman's Bevis Frond, which mixed melodic songcraft with loud power-trio jamming; the droning, druggy haze of Spacemen 3; the quirky college rock of ex-Soft Boy Robyn Hitchcock; the utter weirdness of Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips; and the eclectic Britpop of Wales' Super Furry Animals.

Shibuya-kei -- literally, \"Shibuya style\" -- was the name given to the like-minded pop musicians who emerged from this consumer culture, a group of young Japanese weaned on a steady and amazingly eclectic diet of Western pop exports; the result was an unprecedented collision of sights and sounds, with trailblazing acts like Pizzicato 5 drawing on disparate influences ranging from the lush lounge-pop of Burt Bacharach to the rhythms and energy of urban hip-hop. In its purest form, shibuya-kei is classic Western pop refracted through the looking glass of modern Eastern society -- music cut up, pasted together, and spit out in new and exciting ways. Shibuya-kei is also pop music at its cutest: it's a view to a world where the sweetness and simplicity of the girl-group era never ended but simply evolved, never out of step with the times but always true to its roots as well -- the Lolita complex so pervasive throughout Japanese culture informs much of this music, and its youthful innocence is the key to much of its endearing charm.

While this led journalists and music fans to talk about a post-punk/new wave revival, the movement was really more analogous to a continuum, one that could be traced back as early as the mid-'80s -- scattered bands like Big Flame, World Domination Enterprises, and Minimal Compact, all of whom seemed like natural extensions of post-punk. Some of the more notable bands that recalled the original era during the early and mid-'90s included Six Finger Satellite (who drew from Devo, Suicide, Gang of Four, and the Birthday Party), Brainiac (Devo again, if filtered through Pixies), and Elastica (who acknowledged lifting Wire and the Stranglers).

A fusion of acid-house dance rhythms and melodic pop, Madchester was distinguished by its loping beats, psychedelic flourishes, and hooky choruses. While the song structures were familiar, the arrangements and attitude were modern, and even the retro-pop touches -- namely the jangling guitars, swirling organs, and sharp pop sense -- functioned as postmodern collages. There were two approaches to this collage, as evidenced by the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays. The Roses were a traditional guitar-pop band, and their songs were straight-ahead pop tunes, bolstered by baggy beats; it was modernized '60s pop. Happy Mondays cut and pasted like rappers sampled, taking choruses from the Beatles and LaBelle and putting them into the context of darkly psychedelic dance. Despite their different approaches, both bands shared a love for acid-house music and culture, as well as the hometown of Manchester, England. As the group's popularity grew, the British press tagged the two groups -- as well as similarly-minded bands like the Charlatans [U.K.] and Inspiral Carpets -- \"Madchester\" after a Happy Mondays song. (It was also known as \"baggy,\" since the bands wore baggy clothing). Madchester was enormously popular for several years in the U.K. before fading, largely because the Roses and the Mondays fell prey to laziness and drug abuse, respectively. The genre never made much impact in America outside of alternative circles, but Madchester's offspring -- bands like Oasis, Pulp, and Blur that were heavily influenced by the collision of contemporary and classic pop -- became international stars in the mid-'90s.

As industrial evolved, its avant-garde influences became far less important than its pounding, relentless, jackhammer beats, which helped transform it into a darker alternative to the hedonism of mainstream dance music. Industrial's trademark sound was harsh and menacing, but its rage was subordinate to the intentionally mechanical, numbingly repetitive qualities of the music, which fit the lyrics' themes of alienation and dehumanization quite well. In the early '90s, Ministry and Nine Inch Nails took their variations on industrial to wider alt-rock and metal audiences, but a substantial number of industrial artists chose to remain underground. The first group of industrial bands -- England's Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire, and Germany's Einsturzende Neubauten -- were initially as much about beyond-edgy performance art as they were music. The second generation of industrial artists -- including Skinny Puppy, Front 242, and Nitzer Ebb -- added pummeling dance beats to their predecessors' confrontational sounds, for a substyle often referred to as electronic body music (centered around labels like Wax Trax). Meanwhile, bands like Ministry and KMFDM added metal-guitar riffs, which helped Ministry break through to a wider audience in the late '80s and early '90s; similarly, Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor added more traditional song structures, and made his own persona the focal point, giving the music a rare human presence and becoming a star in the process. This more widely appealing strain of industrial continued to influence alternative metal throughout the '90s.

In that sense, the earliest rock & roll records, most of the garage rock of the '60s, and much of the punk rock of the late '70s could be tagged as Lo-Fi. However, the term came to refer to a breed of underground indie rockers that recorded their material at home on four-track machines. Most of this music grew out of the American underground of the '80s, including bands like R.E.M., as well as a handful of British post-punk bands and New Zealand bands like the Chills and the Clean. Often, these lo-fi bands fluctuated from simple pop and rock songs to free-form song structures to pure noise and arty experimentalism. Even when the groups kept the songs relatively straightforward, the thin quality of the recordings, the layers of tape distortion and hiss, as well as the tendency toward abstract, obtuse lyrics made the music sound different and left of center. Initially, lo-fi recordings were traded on homemade tapes, but several indie labels -- most notably K Records, which was run by Calvin Johnson, who led the lo-fi band Beat Happening -- released albums on vinyl. Several groups in the late '80s, like Pussy Galore, Beat Happening, and Royal Trux earned small cult followings within the American underground. By 1992, groups like Sebadoh and Pavement had become popular cult acts in America and Britain with their willfully noisy, chaotic recordings.

Of course, where the original garage rockers were concerned with imitating their favorite British bands, the revivalists imitate the garage bands themselves -- so their music was full of fuzz-tone guitar, Farfisa organ riffs, and sneering vocals. Like the similarly timed rockabilly and surf revivals, garage rock revivalists also appropriated the original music's sense of style, self-consciously playing up their personal favorite qualities -- toughness, sleaziness, brashness, manic energy, rebellion, party-hearty spirit, what have you. Since it was self-conscious, it was sometimes done with a knowing wink and a bit of exaggeration, but regardless, many of the revival bands shared an underlying assumption that garage rock's virtues embodied the true spirit of rock & roll. Garage rock revival never achieved a wide audience, but after the first wave of '80s bands -- including the Chesterfield Kings, the Mono Men, the Lyres, the Fleshtones, the Fuzztones, and several Billy Childish-led groups -- it did maintain a devoted cult following into the '90s, with numerous bands on the Bomp, Estrus, and Sympathy for the Record Industry labels.

The biggest indie labels might strike distribution deals with major corporate labels, but their decision-making processes remain autonomous. As such, indie rock is free to explore sounds, emotions, and lyrical subjects that don't appeal to large, mainstream audiences -- profit isn't as much of a concern as personal taste (though the labels do, after all, want to stay in business). It's very much rooted in the sound and sensibility of American underground and alternative rock of the '80s, albeit with a few differences that account for the changes in underground rock since then. In the sense that the term is most widely used, indie rock truly separated itself from alternative rock around the time that Nirvana hit the mainstream. Mainstream tastes gradually reshaped alternative into a new form of serious-minded hard rock, in the process making it more predictable and testosterone-driven. Indie rock was a reaction against that phenomenon; not all strains of alternative rock crossed over in Nirvana's wake, and not all of them wanted to, either. Yet while indie rock definitely shares the punk community's concerns about commercialism, it isn't as particular about whether bands remain independent or \"sell out\"; the general assumption is that it's virtually impossible to make indie rock's varying musical approaches compatible with mainstream tastes in the first place. There are almost as many reasons for that incompatibility as there are indie-rock bands, but following are some of the most common: the music may be too whimsical and innocent; too weird; too sensitive and melancholy; too soft and delicate; too dreamy and hypnotic; too personal and intimately revealing in its lyrics; too low-fidelity and low-budget in its production; too angular in its melodies and riffs; too raw, skronky and abrasive; wrapped in too many sheets of Sonic Youth/Dinosaur Jr./Pixies/Jesus & Mary Chain-style guitar noise; too oblique and fractured in its song structures; too influenced by experimental or otherwise unpopular musical styles. Regardless of the specifics, it's rock made by and for outsiders -- much like alternative once was, except that thanks to its crossover, indie rock has a far greater wariness of excess testosterone. It's certainly not that indie rock is never visceral or powerful; it's just rarely -- if ever -- macho about it. As the '90s wore on, indie rock developed quite a few substyles and close cousins (indie pop, dream pop, noise-pop, lo-fi, math rock, post-rock, space rock, sadcore, and emo among them), all of which seemed poised to remain strictly underground phenomena.

Jimmy Eat World officially launched the emo-pop movement in 2001 with Bleed American, whose flagship single \u201cThe Middle\u201d became a top 5 hit.

Its reputation as the darkest and gloomiest form of underground rock is largely deserved, though today that reputation stems more from the visual theatricality of its bands and black-clad followers. Sonically, goth rock took the cold synthesizers and processed guitars of post-punk and used them to construct foreboding, sorrowful, often epic soundscapes. Early on, its lyrics were usually introspective and intensely personal, but its poetic sensibilities soon led to a taste for literary romanticism, morbidity, religious symbolism, and/or supernatural mysticism. Goth rock was generally not a critically acclaimed style, given its penchant for florid poetry, relentlessly mournful dirges, and melodramatic excess. However, it spawned a devoted, still-thriving subculture that kept its aesthetics alive long after the music's initial heyday had passed. The godfathers of goth-rock were British post-punkers Joy Division, whose bleak, remote, obsessively introspective music and lyrics laid the initial foundation for goth. But for all intents and purposes, the true birth of goth rock was \"Bela Lugosi's Dead,\" the 1979 debut single by Bauhaus. Already chilly post-punk outfits like the Cure and Siouxsie & the Banshees became full-on goth bands around the same time, and their heavy, menacing makeup and dark clothes became an important part of their fans' expression. As goth rock's popularity spread among a certain segment of sensitive, alienated youth (first in the U.K., where most of its bands came from, then in the U.S.), its fashion sense grew more and more outlandish, and the original sound evolved somewhat. The Cure, Siouxsie & the Banshees, and the Mission UK incorporated more pop and alternative elements in their music, while the Sisters of Mercy, Fields of the Nephilim, and the American band Christian Death took a heavier, sometimes metal-influenced approach. By the end of the '80s, the original goth-rock movement had ceased to exist, but the music mutated into new forms and continued to influence many of rock's darker subgenres. During the '90s, the goth sound began to cross-pollinate with industrial music, producing hybrids that appealed to both sides, as well as the darkwave subgenre (which also incorporated '80s synth-pop and dream-pop). The latter half of the '90s also saw goth rock's influence cropping up all over heavy metal; a new breed of progressive black metal bands drew heavily from goth's sound and style, while some alternative metal bands also borrowed from goth rock's visual imagery (including Marilyn Manson, who -- despite countless news reports to the contrary -- is not a goth-rock artist).

Attitude and noise were far more important to garage punk than catchy melodies, and the attitude was reflected in the sound of the music: dirty, grimy, sleazy, angry, menacing, and just flat-out ugly. Some of the first garage punk bands who appeared in the late '80s and early '90s (Mudhoney, the Supersuckers) signed with the Sub Pop label, whose early grunge bands shared some of the same influences and aesthetics (in fact, Mudhoney became one of the founders of grunge).

Most college rock was born in the confluence of new wave, post-punk, and early alternative rock. College rock's poppiest bands didn't fit into the mainstream the way new wave did; although it could be arty, it wasn't quite as experimental or detached as much post-punk; and where much early alternative/American underground rock was rooted in punk and hardcore, not all college rock necessarily was (though many of those early alternative bands fit the definition nicely). Early college rock's two most influential groups were R.E.M. and the Smiths, who paved the way for countless practitioners of jangly guitar-pop from the U.S. (the dB's, Let's Active) and U.K. (Housemartins, La's). But college rock encompassed much more. There was the burgeoning, post-hardcore American underground rock scene (H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Sonic Youth, the Minutemen, the Meat Puppets, Dinosaur Jr., the Replacements); the quirky, cerebral British pop of new wave survivors XTC and Robyn Hitchcock; similarly quirky American artists like They Might Be Giants, the Violent Femmes, Camper Van Beethoven, and the Pixies; literate folk-rock (Billy Bragg, he Waterboys, 10,000 Maniacs); post-punkers who added more pop dimensions to their music (the Cure, Siouxsie & the Banshees); synth-based dance-pop with moody, introspective lyrics (New Order, Depeche Mode); and bands who blended pop hooks with ear-splitting guitar noise (the Pixies, the Jesus & Mary Chain). College rock also included a few mainstream stars like U2, Peter Gabriel, and Sting, whose thoughtful lyrics and socially conscious idealism made them favorites on college campuses. College rock's heyday essentially ended with Nirvana's breakthrough in 1991, which opened mainstream ears to the more accessible side of alternative rock; as college radio playlists began to resemble commercial alternative radio, the more experimental branches of alternative and indie rock were driven even further underground.

{"title": "Emo", "url": "https://www.allmusic.com/style/emo-ma0000004447", "discription": "                Originally an arty outgrowth of hardcore punk, emo became an important force in underground rock by the late '90s, appealing to modern-day punks and indie-rockers alike. Some emo leans toward the progressive side, full of complex guitar work, unorthodox song structures, arty noise, and extreme dynamic shifts; some emo is much closer to punk-pop, though it's a bit more intricate. Emo lyrics are deeply personal, usually either free-associative poetry or intimate confessionals. Though it's far less macho, emo is a direct descendant of hardcore's preoccupations with authenticity and anti-commercialism; it grew out of the conviction that commercially oriented music was too artificial and calculated to express any genuine emotion. Because the emo ideal is authentic, deeply felt emotion that defies rational analysis, the style can be prone to excess in its quest for ever-bigger peaks and releases. But at its best, emo has a sweeping power that manages to be visceral, challenging, and intimate all at once. The groundwork for emo was laid by H\u00fcsker D\u00fc's 1984 landmark Zen Arcade, which made it possible for hardcore bands to tackle more personal subject matter and write more tuneful and technically demanding songs. Emo emerged in Washington, D.C. not long after, amidst the remnants of the hardcore scene that had produced Minor Threat and Bad Brains. The term \"emo\" (sometimes lengthened to \"emocore\") was initially used to describe hardcore bands who favored expressive vocals over the typical barking rants; the first true emo band was Rites of Spring, followed by ex-Minor Threat singer Ian MacKaye's short-lived Embrace. MacKaye's Dischord label became the center for D.C.'s growing emo scene, releasing work by Rites of Spring, Dag Nasty, Nation of Ulysses, and MacKaye's collaboration with members of Rites of Spring, Fugazi. Fugazi became the definitive early emo band, crossing over to alternative rock listeners and getting press for their uncompromisingly anti-commercial attitudes. Aside from the Dischord stable, most early emo was deeply underground, recorded by extremely short-lived bands and released on vinyl in small quantities by small labels; some vocalists literally wept onstage during song climaxes, earning derision from hardcore purists. Fugazi notwithstanding, emo didn't really break out of obscurity until the mid-'90s emergence of Sunny Day Real Estate, whose early work defined the style in the minds of many. Tempering Fugazi's gnarled guitar webs with Seattle grunge, straight-up prog-rock, and crooned vocals, SDRE launched a thousand imitators who connected with their dramatic melodies and introspective mysticism. Some of this new generation connected equally with the wry, geeky introspection and catchy punk-pop of Weezer's Pinkerton album. While several artists continued to build on Fugazi's innovations (including Quicksand and Drive Like Jehu), most '90s emo bands borrowed from some combination of Fugazi, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Weezer. Groups like the Promise Ring, the Get Up Kids, Braid, Texas Is the Reason, Jimmy Eat World, Joan of Arc, and Jets to Brazil earned substantial followings in the indie-rock world, making emo one of the more popular underground rock styles at the turn of the millennium.

The late '90s would see a rise in darkwave's popularity thanks to the success of Switchblade Symphony plus Sam Rosenthal's group Black Tape for a Blue Girl.

Britpop, however, refers to the legion of '90s bands who drew more consciously from that tradition than ever before. Although the movement originated in the U.K. indie scene, Britpop was unabashedly commercial - its bands prized big, shiny, catchy hooks, as well as the glamour of mainstream pop stardom and the sense that they were creating the soundtrack to the lives of a new generation of British youth. And it was very definitely British youth they were aiming at; Britpop celebrated and commented on their lives, their culture, and their musical heritage, with little regard for whether that specificity would make them less accessible to American audiences. Britpop's youthful exuberance and desire for recognition were reactions not only against the shy, anti-star personas of the early-'90s shoegazer bands, but also the dourness of American grunge and the faceless producers behind the growing electronic-dance underground. Musically, Britpop drew from the Beatles, of course, but also from the pastoral sound of late-'60s Kinks, the mod movement (the Who, the Small Faces), '70s glam (David Bowie, T. Rex, Roxy Music), punk and new wave (the Jam, the Buzzcocks, Wire, Madness, XTC, Squeeze, Elvis Costello), and the alternative guitar-pop of the Smiths. All those artists were quintessentially British -- they crafted their images, lyrics, and sounds from a distinctly British frame of reference, which was why few of them became anything more than cult artists in the U.S. (and why Britpop functioned much the same way). Apart from those influences, Britpop had its most immediate roots in the Madchester scene, whose emphasis on good times and catchy tunes pointed the way around the shoegazer aesthetic. The Stone Roses' effortless pop hooks and rock-star attitude were the most important part of the foundation, but the true founding fathers of Britpop were Suede. Released in 1993, their self-titled debut became an unexpected smash with its fusion of glam-rock majesty and Smiths introspection. Suede opened the doors for even bigger breakthroughs in 1994 by Blur (Parklife) and Oasis (Definitely Maybe), who quickly became Britpop's two most popular superstars. With their success came a giddy explosion of similarly inspired bands; Elastica, Pulp, Supergrass, and the Boo Radleys were among the biggest. In 1996, Oasis became the only Britpop band to become genuine mainstream stars in the U.S. 1997 brought the first signals that the Britpop boom was beginning to run out of steam, namely Oasis' poorly reviewed third album and Blur's move toward American indie rock, along with the rise of $Radiohead in the wake of their third album, OK Computer.

In the case of British trad rock, the Beatles, Stones, Who, Kinks, Small Faces, and Traffic provided the foundation. All of the trad rockers were obsessed with keeping the music gritty and real -- to capture the vibe of the classic '60s records, they used vintage instruments and didn't deviate from classicist song structures. Oasis and Paul Weller kickstarted the movement in the early '90s with their albums Definitely Maybe and Wildwood. While Oasis deviated from the trad rock formula, there were legions of bands that used their devotion to classic rock as reason to shamelessly replicate '60s rock. Ocean Colour Scene, Cast, Northern Uproar, Embrace, and Kula Shaker all followed the same basic pattern and were tagged by the British press as \"Noelrock,\" in tribute to Oasis' leader, Noel Gallagher.

During the '80s, alternative included everything from jangle pop, post-hardcore punk, funk metal, punk pop, and experimental rock. After Nirvana's popularity in the '90s, alternative included all of these subgenres, but many of the edges were sanded off because the music was now being marketed as part of the mainstream.

It's considered a branch of alternative rock -- even though it may not always sound that way on the surface -- because it doesn't fit any mainstream sensibility, and also because its bands usually get their start as part of the American indie-label scene. In contrast to alternative country, which pushes the boundaries of country music from the inside, alternative country-rock is music made by outsiders who love the sound and spirit of country. They faithfully preserve traditional sounds, but reinterpret the spirit in personal, contemporary, and idiosyncratic ways that rarely appeal to straight country fans. The godfather of alternative country-rock was Gram Parsons, the single most important figure in the invention of country-rock and an enduring cult legend for his deeply emotional records. Neil Young's varying musical personalities were also an important influence, as was the progressive country movement of the '70s, particularly an Austin, TX-centered group of highly literate singer/songwriters like Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, and Jerry Jeff Walker, among others. The man who heralded the birth of alternative country-rock was Lyle Lovett, whose wit and eclecticism seemed to revitalize country's possibilities in the minds of many rock fans. But the first true alternative country-rock band was Uncle Tupelo, who at the start of their career fused punk and country in a far more reverent way than any band in the short-lived '80s cowpunk movement. Their cover of the A.P. Carter spiritual \"No Depression\" gave its name to their seminal 1990 debut album, the premier fanzine chronicling the alt-country scene, and a nickname to the movement in general. Uncle Tupelo soon became a more tradition-minded country-rock outfit, and following their 1993 landmark Anodyne split into two different bands, the staunchly revivalist Son Volt and the more pop-inflected Wilco; by that time, alternative country-rock itself had begun to split into several strains. One school was chiefly dedicated to reviving the Parsons/Young sound of the early '70s, sometimes adding elements of Beatlesque pop to their crunchy rockers and aching ballads. Others were sincere traditionalists, drawing from the most haunting qualities of old-time country and Appalachian folk while updating the lyrical sensibilities just enough. A related school made that old-timey sound into a soft, spare, ethereal hybrid of country and indie rock, usually featuring a female vocalist. Still other alt-country-rock bands brought a sense of humor to their traditionalist work, whether it was the good-natured wit of a twangy, rollicking bar band, or the flat-out weird irony of Lambchop.

Although alternative dance music doesn't seem out of place at a dance club, it also works just as effectively outside of that environment, because of its pop accessibility and willingness to incorporate other styles of music. Those qualities put a more human face on alternative dance, as opposed to the more mechanized feel of much standard club/dance music; as a result, the performers are much more closely identified with their music, which often possesses a signature style, texture, or fusion of specific musical elements. Many alternative dance artists are British, owing to the greater prominence of the U.K.'s club  and rave scenes in underground musical culture -- their creative fertility helped stimulate more musical experimentation. New Order was the first alternative dance group, pioneering the style with their 1982-83 recordings, which fused icy, gloomy post-punk with Kraftwerk-style synth-pop. In addition to alternative rock, alternative dance was most heavily influenced by synth-pop, acid house, and trip-hop; each of those movements helped spawn a corresponding cachet of alternative dance artists, and had a major impact on Britain's late-'80s Madchester scene, as well as the pop crossover success of several indie-oriented trip-hop artists during the '90s.

{"title": "Adult Alternative Pop/Rock", "url": "https://www.allmusic.com/style/adult-alternative-pop-rock-ma0000004488", "discription": "                One of the branches of alternative rock that emerged after the genre's absorption into the mainstream, adult alternative pop/rock is a smooth, melodic, radio-friendly style that packaged alternative's mellower side for wider consumption. Commercial viability is usually an important part of adult alternative pop/rock, but artists don't always aim for it -- their individual approaches may simply turn out to be compatible with the style's sensibility. And adult alternative pop/rock is more of a sensibility than any one set sound. Its artists might draw from the alt-rock tradition of intelligent guitar-pop, particularly early-'80s jangle-pop (Gin Blossoms, Barenaked Ladies, Goo Goo Dolls); acoustic folk-rock, especially the intimate, confessional poetry of the singer/songwriter tradition (Indigo Girls, Tori Amos, Jeff Buckley, Sarah McLachlan, Fiona Apple, Jewel); the rootsy, easygoing rock & roll of the American trad rock movement (Sheryl Crow, Hootie & the Blowfish, Dave Matthews); or the moody, stylish electronics of trip-hop (Portishead), to name the most dominant influences. What ties adult alternative pop/rock together is a sense of maturity: it's essentially mainstream, pop/rock-based music of the '90s that appeals to a more refined, mellowed-out adult sensibility, intentionally or otherwise. The rock & rollers tended to be more laid-back, prizing songcraft and good vibes above visceral energy, and the others -- especially the singer/songwriters -- made music for thoughtful contemplation. At its worst, adult alternative pop/rock was a superficial approximation of the substance in its alt-rock inspirations -- often because of performers' assumptions about what constituted maturity. Anxious to make music that was pretty and likable, some artists wound up inoffensive to the point of blandness; others self-consciously tried to sound \"deep,\" resulting in forced melancholia and heaps of overwrought, amateurish poetry. But at its best, the style gained significant exposure for artists who were ambitious, intellectual, and/or idiosyncratic, yet still accessible enough to meet the requirements of mainstream radio programmers who wanted more sophisticated music that wasn't loud or overly disturbing.

While weaned on punk, the American underground bands tended to favor a broader musical palate (hard rock, psychedelia, roots rock, folk-rock, and country-rock influences were the most common), though they continued to be dominated by electric guitars and a lyrical perspective that reached for intelligence without outward pretension. These bands  also tended to favor independent labels and low-budget touring, as much out of necessity as any dominant philosophical tenant, since nearly all of them were ignored by major labels, forcing them to find other avenues to present their music. While they were progenitors of the hardcore punk scene, Black Flag were also the primary trailblazers of the American underground scene, in effect creating an indie touring network through several years of relentless roadwork; the band\u2019s label, SST, was also a crucial influence, releasing records by the Minutemen, the Meat Puppets, Husker Du, Dinosaur Jr., and other key bands who pushed the outsider\u2019s aggression of punk into new and provocative directions. The Midwest proved to be a potent breeding ground for the American underground, with Minneapolis\u2019s boozy but heartfelt the Replacements and Chicago\u2019s brutally loud Big Black and Naked Raygun winning sizable cult followings, while Sonic Youth and the Swans were the rulers of a dissonant East Coast enclave, Texas\u2019s nomadic psych-noise merchants the Butthole Surfers were leaving a trail of terror across the country, and Boston\u2019s Mission of Burma proved both powerfully influential and prescient during their short lifespan. In the mid-'80s, the initial commercial breakthrough of R.E.M. (who were tangential members of the scene despite their presence on the semi-major label  I.R.S.) at once gave the American underground new visibility and put the first chinks into the armor of the close-knit community. By the early '90s, the hard work and relative success of several  important American underground bands ultimately proved to be the movement\u2019s undoing; many of the movement\u2019s major acts were wooed away by major labels (where most failed to find sizable audiences in the United States, though some fared better in Europe), and with the breakthrough of Nirvana at the end of 1991, the underground began to splinter, for the most part dividing into alternative rock (for the more commercially accessible bands) and indie rock (for their less compromising counterparts).

Its receptiveness to rock & roll made it a definite precursor of funk, whose hard-driving rhythms and use of electronics and instrumental effects owed much to the ground broken by psychedelic soul. The music was often state-of-the-art soul at its most celebratory, evoking the heady good times of a new, multifaceted cultural openness. But there was also a darker, sometimes even paranoid side to the music that reflected its uncertain social times, particularly the increasing militancy of the civil rights movement. By the '70s, psychedelic soul had evolved into a mix of protest material, aggressive funk, and gently shimmering love songs. The catalyst behind psychedelic soul was Jimi Hendrix, who cut his teeth on the R&B circuit before coming into his own as a mind- and genre-bending instrumentalist who spoke to both white and black listeners. Similarly eclectic but more firmly based in R&B were Sly & the Family Stone, a racially integrated outfit forged in the psychedelic hotbed of San Francisco. Perhaps the quintessential psychedelic soul band, the Family Stone's social awareness and euphoric positivity gave way to a darker, more pessimistic vision, as drugs took their toll on Sly Stone's mental stability. Meanwhile, the Temptations, under the auspices of producer/arranger Norman Whitfield, redefined themselves by cutting some of the finest psychedelic soul of the late '60s and early '70s, including hits like \"Papa Was a Rolling Stone\" and \"Ball of Confusion.\" Whitfield was also responsible for other psychedelic soul classics like Edwin Starr's \"War\" and the Undisputed Truth's \"Smiling Faces Sometimes.\" Psychedelic soul remained a part of R&B's cutting edge into the '70s, as many early funk artists -- Curtis Mayfield, Earth, Wind & Fire, the Isley Brothers, etc. -- made it a component of their sound. None did so more than George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic aggregate, whose bizarre, druggy humor and acid-tinged jamming were direct outgrowths of psychedelic soul.            "}

For many others, it's a term that means everything. Where most soul genres are named for either the region that the music where the music was created, or for the sound of the music, Northern soul is named after where the music was played -- in dance clubs in northern Britain. During the early '70s, once the mods had run out of steam and prog rock was ruling the landscape, there were a handful of underground dance clubs that played nothing but '60s soul records, and they weren't any ordinary oldies. Instead, the DJs at these clubs were obsessive collectors, finding the most obscure American soul singles. Usually, these records sounded like Motown, Chicago soul, or New York soul, but they were records by unknown or underappreciated performers; Major Lance was one of the biggest names on the scene. These records were dubbed Northern soul because of the clubs. Northern soul continued to gain popularity until the mid-'70s, when punk and disco stole its thunder; however, it never really faded away. Some clubs remained open and there was still a collectors' market for the singles, and many rare singles were going for astonishingly high prices. Most importantly, many clubgoers, from Marc Almond to Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs of St. Etienne, went on to form their own groups, which kept the spirit of Northern soul alive.            "}

It was also the least structured, often stretching out into extended jams, and the most Africanized, built on dynamic, highly syncopated polyrhythms. As such, it originally appealed only to hardcore R&B audiences. The groove was the most important musical element of funk -- all the instruments of the ensemble played off of one another to create it, and worked it over and over. Deep electric bass lines often served as main riffs, with an interlocking web of short, scratchy guitar chords and blaring horns over the top. Unlike nearly every form of R&B that had come before it, funk didn't confine itself to the 45-rpm single format and the classic verse/chorus song structure. Funk bands were just as likely to repeat a catchy chant or hook out of the blue, and to give different song sections equal weight, so as not to disrupt the groove by building to a chorus-type climax. In essence, funk allowed for more freedom and improvisation, and in that respect it was similar to what was happening around the same time in blues-rock, psychedelia, and hard rock (in fact, Jimi Hendrix was a major inspiration for funk guitar soloists). The roots of funk lay in James Brown's post-1965 soul hits, particularly \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" (1965) and \"Cold Sweat\" (1967). Sly & the Family Stone, who started out as a soul band influenced by rock and psychedelia, became a full-fledged (albeit pop-savvy) funk outfit with 1969's Stand!. However, the record that officially ushered in the funk era was James Brown's epochal \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine.\" The arrangement was spare, the groove hard-hitting, and Brown's lyrics were either stream-of-consciousness slogans or wordless noises. Brown followed it with more records over the course of 1970 that revolutionized R&B, and paved the way for the third artist of funk's holy trinity, George Clinton. Clinton's Parliament and Funkadelic outfits made funk the ultimate party music, not just with their bizarre conceptual humor, but their sheer excess -- huge ensembles of musicians and dancers, all jamming on the same groove as long as they possibly could. Thanks to Sly, Brown, and Clinton, many new and veteran R&B acts adopted funk as a central style during the '70s. Funk gradually became smoother as disco came to prominence in the mid- to late '70s, and lost much of its distinguishing earthiness. However, it had a major impact on jazz (both fusion and soul-jazz), and became the musical foundation of hip-hop. Thanks to the latter, funk enjoyed a renaissance during the '90s, especially among white audiences who rushed to explore its original classics.            "}

During the '60s, Berry Gordy, Jr.'s Detroit label became the biggest independent in the music industry, thanks to its smooth, sophisticated blend of R&B and memorable pop melodies. At Motown, the pop side of the equation took on greater importance than ever before, which helped make the records accessible to a wider audience; their velvety elegance helped cement black popular music firmly into mainstream American culture. Motown often utilized the same core session musicians on their records, which helped lay the Motown sound's basic rhythmic foundation of bouncing bass and echoing drums. But their arrangements were frequently lush and elaborate, adding strings, horns, woodwinds, piano, extra percussion, or whatever else might enhance the music's urbane stylishness. This polished pop craftsmanship, when matched with the smoothly soulful vocals of the Motown artist roster, became ubiquitously popular during the early '60s, with songwriters like Smokey Robinson and the team of Eddie Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Brian Holland turning out one gem after another with almost assembly-line regularity. When Holland, Dozier and Holland left the label in a dispute over royalties, producer Norman Whitfield became a major figure at Motown, keeping the label in step with the harder, funkier direction much soul music was heading in. In 1970, the Jackson 5 became superstars with a funky bubblegum-soul that began to break away from established Motown formulas, and during the rest of the decade, performers like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder took greater control of their own music, investing it with their own personalities and helping break up the standardized Motown blueprint.

Like quiet storm and Philly soul, both strong influences, urban was very smooth and polished, but while its romantic ballads fit well into quiet storm radio formats, urban also had room for uptempo, funky dance tracks, which usually boasted the same high-tech, radio-ready production and controlled yet soulful vocals. That's why, in spite of its name, urban didn't usually have the earthy grit associated with the term \"soul music,\" preferring to tone down the raw emotion in favor of a slick refinement. Up until the late '80s, most urban music was highly pop-oriented, often in melody but nearly always in terms of production. A number of artists -- like Janet Jackson, Billy Ocean, and Whitney Houston -- crossed over from the R&B charts to the pop charts, although there were others like Freddie Jackson, Luther Vandross, Stephanie Mills, and Levert whose R&B popularity never translated quite the same way. The urban landscape began to shift with the advent of hip-hop; producer and Guy member Teddy Riley crafted a fusion of the two, inserted occasional rap breaks, and dubbed it new jack swing. New jack made a superstar of Bobby Brown and proved greatly beneficial to his ex-New Edition mates as well. In addition to Riley, songwriting/production duos whose work straddled pop and R&B -- like Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis (Janet Jackson), Denzil Foster & Thomas McElroy (En Vogue), and Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid & Babyface -- dominated urban music at the turn of the decade, with Babyface going on to a hugely successful singing career in his own right. Urban and hip-hop continued to cross-pollinate during the early '90s, eventually resulting in a new hybrid tagged \"hip-hop soul.\" Hip-hop soul was rooted in new jack swing, but the beats were funkier, more elastic and unpredictable; while hip-hop soul was still slickly produced, it had a grittier, more soulful feel than new jack. There was still a side of urban that retained roots in quiet storm and adult contemporary, though, and regardless of which side of the spectrum they fell on, the songs were increasingly becoming showpieces for elaborate vocal technique. Partly owing to the steep decline of mainstream pop/rock in the wake of alternative, urban more or less dominated the pop singles charts for the latter half of the '90s, with major acts including Mary J. Blige, Toni Braxton, R. Kelly, Boyz II Men, SWV, Blackstreet, Jodeci, Monica, and Brandy, among others.            "}

Quiet Storm also drew inspiration from Marvin Gaye's lush Let's Get It On LP, the orchestrations of Philly soul, and the gentle, ultra-smooth recordings of Al Green. In a way, quiet storm was R&B's answer to soft rock and adult contemporary -- while it was primarily intended for black audiences, quiet storm had the same understated dynamics, relaxed tempos and rhythms, and romantic sentiment. However, there was also an urbane sophistication and subdued soulfulness that marked quiet storm as unmistakably rooted in R&B. Some artists concentrated near-exclusively on the style, but most recorded more uptempo tracks in addition to the ballads that fit the requirements of the radio format. Quiet storm remained popular from the late '70s into the early '90s, when mainstream R&B took on a harder-edged hip-hop influence; as a result, quiet storm found virtually no new practitioners.

As the use of drum machines, synthesizers, and sequencers dominated R&B-rooted music throughout the '80s, '90s, and early 2000s, making much of the genre producer-oriented and palatable to pop radio and younger clubbing audiences, adult contemporary R&B tended to take most of its cues from the more refined strains of '70s soul, such as smooth soul, Philly soul, and quiet storm. Classic songwriting touches and organic-leaning instrumentation, often featuring string arrangements and horn charts, were constants, but that didn't mean adult contemporary R&B remained static throughout the decades, or that it even stuck to a purist's definition of proper R&B.

It also happened to have a funk soundtrack -- appropriate, since funk was the cutting-edge music of the time. As it would turn out, Sweet Sweetback ushered in an era of filmmaking that wasn't nearly as serious as Van Peebles' movie. Quite quickly, his innovations were diluted and channeled into a genre called blaxploitation. Where Sweet Sweetback was serious as a heart attack, blaxploitation -- with a few exceptions -- was lightweight, telling tales of detectives, outlaws, pimps, and hustlers. It played to a broad audience, and it found it. And those films were given funk soundtracks, similar to Sweet Sweetback -- filled with wah-wah guitars, big bass, and funky beats -- but the newer soundtracks were richer and more diverse. Much of this music held up better than the films themselves, even in the case of Superfly, one of the better blaxploitation films of the time, where Curtis Mayfield's music was better than the film. As the movie genre died out in the late '70s, so did the music, but both the films and the soundtracks remained cult favorites well into the next century.            "}

Early musical theater split into three main groups, musical comedy, which featured simple songs and everyday characters, the revue, which used a variety format, and American versions of the operetta, which had more complex musical compositions and usually featured romantic themes. Musical theater in the first few decades of the 20th century relied on huge stars like Al Jolson and Fanny Brice to propel it to profitability, and the entertainment industry became centralized in New York, giving rise to the Broadway theater scene, where musicals flourished.  Show Boat, which opened in 1928, helped usher in a new standard for the integration of character, story and music in musicals which would be met and surpassed during the musical's golden age - a period which would last until the late '50s and feature great composers like Leonard Bernstein, Rogers and Hammerstein, George and Ira Gershwin and Rodgers and Hart.  The musical made a major impact on films from the early days of the talkies, through the end of its golden age, and stars like Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Ethel Merman and Mary Martin helped spread its popularity across the whole country.Musical theater post-1960 featured both a revival of classic shows and the creation of new works that build upon and challenge the conventions of traditional musical theater.  The huge productions of Andrew Lloyd Weber drew international crowds, while the work of Bob Fosse echoed back to the smaller productions of the 20s (while also drawing fairly substantial crowds). New York remained the heart of musical theater, but shows toured frequently and cities like London and Chicago also developed original shows that made major impacts.            "}

In the late '80s, Southern rap was primarily associated with Miami bass music, also popularly known as \"booty rap\" both for its rump-shaking grooves and the central preoccupation of its lyrics. Chief among its artists was Luther Campbell's 2 Live Crew, which took the sexual content of its lyrics to a hard-partying extreme, provoking outcries from pro-censorship forces across the country. The sound of Miami bass spread through the rest of the South and remained a national dance-floor staple through the '90s, with artists like Tag Team, 95 South, the 69 Boyz, Quad City DJ's, and Freak Nasty all scoring huge hit singles (albeit with lyrics far less explicit than Campbell's). Atlanta had its share of bass-heavy party rap artists, but also offered a quirkier, more distinctive (and critically acclaimed) style incorporating the funk of classic Southern soul. The cerebral Arrested Development was the first to hit the national scene in 1992, and they were followed a few years later by prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of the harder-edged Organized Noize production squad, most notably OutKast and Goodie Mob. If Atlanta was the creative center of Southern rap, New Orleans was surely its commercial center. Master P built a lucrative empire with No Limit record label, and even if he and his roster didn't really push the envelope artistically -- most No Limit albums stuck to West Coast G-funk, Wu-Tang-style hardcore, and nothing but straight-up gangsta lyrics -- No Limit pumped out product with assembly-line efficiency and became a constant presence on the national album charts during the late '90s. Toward the end of the decade, fellow New Orleans label Cash Money and its house producer Mannie Fresh -- whose distinctive approach reworked the Southern bass sound -- scored a national breakout with Juvenile, establishing them as a legitimate rival force.

Still, even if Dre's patented G-funk defined the West Coast sound and style for many, California's rap scene was a great deal more diverse. Up until the mid- to late '80s, West Coast rap mostly imitated East Coast party rap, already considered old-school in its place of origin; however, both Los Angeles and the Bay Area soon proved to be fertile pastures. The former produced the landmark proto-gangsta recordings of Ice-T, the hugely influential, Latino-tinged stoner funk of Cypress Hill, and the warped comedy of the Pharcyde; the Bay Area countered with the pimp-obsessed rhymes of Too $hort, the P-Funk-inspired, good-humored Digital Underground, and the pop breakthrough of MC Hammer. In short, West Coast rap became as eclectic and difficult to pigeonhole as East Coast rap. However, N.W.A.'s 1989 gangsta-rap landmark Straight Outta Compton set the stage for a more identifiable West Coast style -- its sound was hard-hitting and minimalistic, its lyrics alternating between violent hedonism and righteously angry social commentary. Upon leaving N.W.A., Ice Cube made solo records which maintained that lyrical tone while employing noisy, Public Enemy-style production; his bandmate Dr. Dre discovered Snoop Doggy Dogg, signed to Death Row Records, and at the end of 1992 released The Chronic, the album that defined G-funk and spawned legions of imitators. The Chronic's gangsta hedonism and production style -- whiny synthesizers, rolling P-Funk beats, and deep, slow grooves -- provided the blueprint that made Death Row the biggest hip-hop label of the early '90s, scoring hits by Snoop, Warren G., Tha Dogg Pound, and more. Controversial gangsta star 2Pac joined the label in late 1995 and became a crossover superstar with the Dre duet \"California Love,\" and Coolio had taken a more pop-oriented version of the West Coast sound to the top of the charts earlier in the year with \"Gangsta's Paradise.\" However, West Coast dominance soon crumbled -- 2Pac was murdered in 1996, Dre jumped ship, and Death Row CEO Suge Knight was jailed over business practices. By the end of the '90s, hip-hop's focus had turned back to the East Coast and to the emerging South.            "}

Soon, many U.K. rappers were adding acid-house flourishes to their sound, resulting in a music style that was darker than its American counterpart.

Old school is easily identified by its relatively simple raps -- most lines take up approximately equal amounts of time, and the rhythms of the language rarely twisted around the beats of the song. The cadences usually fell squarely on the beat, and when they didn't, they wouldn't stray for long, returning to the original pattern for quick resolution. The emphasis was not on lyrical technique, but simply on good times -- aside from the socially conscious material of Grandmaster Flash, which greatly expanded rap's horizons, most old-school rap had the fun, playful flavor of the block parties and dances at which it was born. In keeping with the laid-back, communal good vibes, old-school rap seemed to have more room and appreciation for female MCs, although none achieved the higher profile of Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five or the Sugarhill Gang. Some old-school songs were performed over disco or funk-style tracks, while others featured synthesized backing (this latter type of music, either with or without raps, was known as electro). Old-school rap's recorded history begins with two 1979 singles, Fatback's \"King Tim III\" and the Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight,\" although the movement had been taking shape for almost a decade prior. Sugarhill Records quickly became the center for old-school rap, dominating the market until Run-D.M.C. upped the ante for technique and hardcore urban toughness in 1983-84. Their sound and style soon took over the rap world, making old-school's party orientation and '70s funk influences seem outdated. When compared with the more complex rhythms and rhyme schemes of modern-day rap -- or even the hip-hop that was being produced less than ten years after \"Rapper's Delight\" -- old-school rap can sound dated and a little unadventurous. However, the best old-school tracks retain their liveliness as great party music no matter what the era, holding up surprisingly well considering all that's happened since.            "}

Hardcore rap is tough, streetwise, intense, and often menacing (although the latter isn't always the case; there is room for humor and exuberance as well). Gangsta rap is the style most commonly associated with hardcore rap, but not all hardcore rap revolves around gangsta themes, even though there is a great deal of overlap, especially among hardcore rappers of the '90s. The first hardcore rap came from the East Coast during the late '80s, when artists began to move away from party rhymes and bragging about their microphone skills; their music and language began to reflect the gritty, often harsh urban surroundings in which it was usually created and enjoyed. Before any specific formula for gangsta rap had been invented, artists like New York's Boogie Down Productions and L.A.'s Ice-T were committing detailed observations of street life to tape; plus, Public Enemy's chaotic sound collages were setting new standards for production power, and N.W.A. celebrated the bleakness of the ghetto and the gangsta lifestyle with an over-the-top machismo. In the early '90s, hardcore rap was essentially synonymous with West Coast gangsta rap until the 1993 emergence of the Wu-Tang Clan, whose spare, minimalistic beats and haunting string and piano samples became a widely imitated style. With its slamming, hard-hitting grooves and street-tough urban grit, hardcore rap became hip-hop's most popular crossover style during the latter half of the '90s, its subject matter now a mix of party anthems, gangsta's money/sex/violence obsessions, and occasional social commentary. Artists like the Notorious B.I.G., DMX, and Jay-Z became platinum-selling superstars, and Master P's brand of gangsta-oriented Southern hardcore also became a lucrative commercial force, even if it didn't produce crossover hit singles on the same level.

All of rap's most important early artists were based in the New York City area -- old-school legends like DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, the Sugarhill Gang, Kurtis Blow, and Run-D.M.C. As rap grew and became more diverse over the course of the '80s, productive scenes began to spring up in other locations around the country; nonetheless, East Coast rap dominated through most of the '80s. Although the sound of East Coast rap wasn't completely uniform, from the mid- to late '80s it tended to gravitate to more aggressive beats and sample collages, and many MCs prided themselves on their technical dexterity in crafting lyrics. In other words, with some exceptions East Coast rap became a music intended more for intense listening than for the dancefloor, helping develop the genre into a respected art form as it grew more elaborate and complex. Typifying this golden era of the East Coast sound were artists like Eric B. & Rakim, Boogie Down Productions, and Slick Rick, all of whom boasted immense lyrical skill rooted in old-school style, as well as the harder-hitting sounds of EPMD and Public Enemy. Also based on the East Coast were the Native Tongues, a collective of positive, Afrocentric artists assembled by Afrika Bambaataa; while De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, the Jungle Brothers, and other, mostly New York-based groups had a major impact on hip-hop in the late '80s, they were more readily identified with their musical eclecticism than any specific geographic location. N.W.A's 1989 album Straight Outta Compton served notice that the West Coast had toughened its sound to go along with its already gritty, street-level subject matter; combined with West Coast rap's ability to retain its primary function as party music, this helped make it the dominant force in hip-hop during the '90s. The rise of Southern rap further ensured that East Coast rap could no longer dominate as it once had, but the '90s were hardly a wash for the region. In addition to Puff Daddy's hugely lucrative, pop-accessible Bad Boy label, the East Coast produced its share of varied, highly acclaimed artists, including lyrical virtuoso Nas, the eclectic Fugees and Roots, and the hugely influential hardcore unit Wu-Tang Clan.

After all, to have any chance at radio airplay and commercial crossover, tracks obviously needed a vocal focus. Inevitably, the mixers responsible for the first hip-hop street jams were inevitably pushed to the back. Though the balance will probably never be righted, the increasing focus on all aspects of rap culture during the mid-'90s resulted in the emergence of Turntablism as a separate style. The stars here were the DJs, and instead of tight rhymes and smooth flow in their repertoire, they had scratching, spinbacks, phasing, and two-turntable acrobatics (or beat juggling). Some of the most popular mixers (DJ Shadow, most notably) constructed their mixes with literally thousands of records at their disposal, and the more obscure the better. Most were either drum breaks from rare jazz, soul, or funk records (instructional and educational records were also popular, given the nonsensical vocal samples). The avant-garde figure Christian Marclay began constructing turntable symphonies in the early '80s, using material from a variety of musical sources. In 1987, a relic of the disco era named the Disco Mix Club (later just DMC) held its first mixing championship. The contest soon became the stage for turntablists to flaunt their talents and earn the respect of their peers. Excellent second-generation DJs like QBert, Mixmaster Mike, DJ Apollo, and Rob Swift became leading figures of the emerging turntablism, some as individuals and some as part of new turntablist collectives like Invisibl Skratch Piklz, the X-Men (later the X-Ecutioners), and the Beat Junkies. Though albums by turntablists never quite crossed over to rock audiences, a new breed of mixer -- exemplified by DJ Shadow -- earned acclaim in critical quarters by downplaying the role of live performance and physical skills in favor of full-length studio works of art.

Inspired by '70s political preachers from the Last Poets to Gil Scott-Heron, Public Enemy were the first and best of the political rap groups. Frontman Chuck D. twisted rhymes better than any other rapper to date, all the while taking to task the government (\"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos,\" \"Fight the Power\"), the culture of white America (\"Rebel Without a Pause,\" \"Burn Hollywood Burn\"), and all sorts of specific sociopolitical issues (\"911 Is a Joke,\" \"Night of the Living Baseheads\") over the sonic terrorism of PE's production crew, the Bomb Squad. KRS-One and his group, Boogie Down Productions, began speaking out as well, with brutal broadsides like \"Illegal Business\" and \"Stop the Violence\" that spoke to the black community as well as the leaders of the free world. What looked to be a fertile new ground for exploration, however, proved remarkably short-lived. Public Enemy trailed off after 1991, and despite great recordings from a new generation of political rappers (Poor Righteous Teachers, Paris, X-Clan, Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy), the commercial explosion of a new hip-hop sound -- gangsta rap or G-funk -- made record labels less adventurous about nonestablishment messages.

Rhymers like PE's Chuck D., Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, and Rakim basically invented the complex wordplay and lyrical kung-fu of later hip-hop. The Def Jam label became the first big independent in hip-hop, while Cold Chillin', Jive, and Tommy Boy also made strides.            "}

For this reason, though vocals may be (and often are) included on left-field albums, they tend to function more as a rhythmic element as opposed to show off verbal prowess, though of course entire verses may be present. Most left-fielders use a variety of complex computerized equipment to mix and create their music, but there are often other experimental elements in left-field hip-hop, from a diverse sample set to live instrumentation and vocals. However, there is also generally the underlying idea that what is being produced could have rapping over it. Left-field hip-hop separates itself from turntablism in that it relies less on sampling in creating a composition, as well as the fact that it is more of a studio-based art form. It came into being as turntablism became less prevalent, and focuses more on studio work - including bringing in featured artists - as opposed to live performance, though again, of course, many left-fielders often display their work in public.

While the rhythms of jazz-rap came entirely from hip-hop, the samples and sonic textures were drawn mainly from cool jazz, soul-jazz, and hard bop. It was cooler and more cerebral than other styles of hip-hop, and many of its artists displayed an Afrocentric political consciousness, complementing the style's historical awareness. Given its more intellectual bent, it's not surprising that jazz-rap never really caught on as a street favorite, but then it wasn't meant to. Jazz-rap styled itself as a more positive alternative to the hardcore/gangsta movement taking over rap's mainstream at the dawn of the '90s, and concerned itself with spreading hip-hop to listeners unable to embrace or identify with the music's increasing inner-city aggression. As such, jazz-rap found its main audiences in places like college campuses, and was also embraced by a number of critics and white alternative rock fans. Afrika Bambaataa's Native Tongues posse -- a loose collective of New York-based, Afrocentric rap groups -- was the most important force in jazz-rap, including groups like A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul and the Jungle Brothers; Digable Planets and Gang Starr were other notable early artists. During the mid- to late '90s, as alternative rap moved into a wider-ranging eclecticism, jazz-rap was not often pursued as an exclusive end, although the Roots frequently incorporated it in their live-instrumentation hip-hop.

When African slaves were brought to the United States and Christianized, they began to perceive Biblical parallels to their own situation (and were sometimes even encouraged to do so by zealously evangelical whites). Thus, many spirituals address themes of freedom, earthly suffering, and hope for deliverance. They were sung both at worship services and in the fields, and were passed down orally from generation to generation. Given those origins, spirituals are usually performed very simply and written in repetitive, easily remembered structures (for example, many verses in spirituals include a one-line refrain that's sung by the entire group and repeated after each new line of the verse).

Composer and singer Thomas A. Dorsey crystallized the style in 1932 with his epochal \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord,\" and went on to compose a great many songs that later became standards. When performed in the churches, the music was traditionally sung by a choir, with individual soloists sometimes taking the spotlight; this often happened in a form known as \"call and response,\" in which either the choir or the soloist would repeat and/or answer the lyric which had just been sung by the other, with the soloist improvising embellishments of the melody for greater emphasis. As the music developed, these soloists became more and more virtuosic, performing with wild emotion (and, in the South, physicality) in order to properly express the spiritual ecstasy the music was meant to evoke. The music was quite egalitarian in terms of gender, as both male and female performers -- Brother Joe May, Rev. James Cleveland, Mahalia Jackson, the Clara Ward Singers, etc. -- gained wide renown among both black and white audiences. The small-group format was also prevalent, with major figures including the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, the Soul Stirrers, the Swan Silvertones, and the Dixie Hummingbirds; in general, these groups placed a greater premium on smooth vocal harmonies, although some performances could approach the raucous energy (if not quite the huge sound) of a choir-with-soloist group. As the years progressed, black gospel and black popular music influenced and borrowed from one another, reflecting the gradual change of emphasis toward R&B; black gospel also had an enormous impact on the development of soul music, which directed gospel's spiritual intensity into more secular concerns, and included a great many performers whose musical skills were developed in the church. As a recognizable style unto itself, black gospel music largely ceased to develop around the 1970s; progressing racial attitudes had helped black popular music reach wider audiences (and become more lucrative) than ever before, and tastes had turned towards the earthy hedonism of funk and the highly arranged, sophisticated Philly soul sound. The former wasn't quite appropriate for worship, and it wasn't all that practical to duplicate the latter in church services. However, the traditional black gospel sound survived intact and was eventually augmented by contemporary gospel (an '80s/'90s variation strongly influenced by latter-day urban R&B); plus, singers like Whitney Houston continued to develop within its ranks.

In congregational settings hymns are often sung in unison but they also flourish in four-part vocal harmony and large choir settings as well. In the mid to late 1700s, Charles Wesley (who adapted, wrote, arranged or had his hand in on some 6,000 hymns) introduced the concept of a personal song to God into the equation and many modern hymns have moved in that direction, allowing strong lead voices to step out of the choir and perform as soloists. Other church choirs developed an unaccompanied a cappella approach to hymns, and in time, gospel, which specialized in reshaping hymns into expressions of personal testimony, emerged and prospered. By the 21st Century hymnists were writing hymns and arranging them in a pop setting with drums and guitars and a general rock approach, and the debate over what is and what isn't a hymn has been going on for centuries now. At the very least, a hymn is addressed to God, and is designed-whether personal or congregational-to be devout, no matter which revivalist or traditionalist movement is afoot or how the message is delivered.

It was initially a somewhat controversial style in Christian circles, as more conservative elements believed all rock & roll to be inherently evil by nature, and gospel radio programmers were accordingly reluctant to program the music when it appeared during the mid-'70s. But others began to see Christian rock as an effective way to reach the unconverted, wrapping spiritual messages in an attractive package that strongly resembled a highly popular mainstream musical style. Petra's two Dove Award nominations in 1984 effectively signaled the gospel music community's acceptance of Christian rock as a viable and legitimate form, and helped pave the way for the heavier, flashier Christian style known as heaven's metal (itself an attempt to hook secular fans with an already established sound and spiritual lyrics). Harder, more uptempo Christian rock songs often try to project a firm, tough-minded, unshakable religious attitude, in keeping with the aggressive sound of the music, although many Christian rock bands have a fondness for majestic, sweeping power ballads; in both cases, the polished, squeaky-clean production is often just as close to the sheen of CCM pop as to the already slick sound of much AOR. Although some Christian rock bands experimented with rawer, more biting sounds in the late '80s and early '90s, the associations between the established conventions of big, anthemic hooks, loud yet smoothed-out guitars, and intense (yet fundamentally safe) spiritual emotion never completely died down. That time period also witnessed the unique phenomenon of King's X, a band with roots in Christian rock which garnered a devoted cult following among secular listeners and critics, thanks to its willingness to deviate from established musical formulas and address spirituality in more general terms. As alternative CCM began to capture larger portions of the Christian rock audience during the mid- to late '90s, many Christian rock heavyweights conceded the impact of mainstream alternative rock and shifted their brands of hard rock accordingly, although Petra soldiered on into the new millennium with their sound virtually unchanged.

Disco was named after discotheques, clubs that played nothing but music for dancing. Most of the discotheques were gay clubs in New York, and the DJs in these clubs specifically picked soul and funk records that had a strong, heavy groove. After being played in the disco, the records began receiving radio play and respectable sales. Soon, record companies and producers were cutting records created specifically for discos. Naturally, these records also had strong pop hooks, so they could have crossover success. Disco albums frequently didn't have many tracks -- they had a handful of long songs that kept the beat going. Similarly, the singles were issued on 12-inch records, which allowed for extended remixes. DJs could mix these tracks together, matching the beats on each song since they were marked with how fast they were in terms of beats per minute. In no time, the insistent, pounding disco beat dominated the pop chart, and everyone cut a disco record, from rockers like the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart to pop acts like the Bee Gees and new wave artists like Blondie. There were disco artists that became stars -- Donna Summer, Chic, the Village People, and KC & the Sunshine Band were brand names -- but the music was primarily a producer's medium, since they created the tracks and wrote the songs.

Deep funk rarely innovates within the form, generally taking its cues from the hard, lean brand of funk epitomized by James Brown and the Meters, or -- depending on the level of musicianship -- moving into jazzier, more improvisational territory. Some of it was recorded for major labels and lost in the shuffle, and some was cut for small independent labels with poor distribution. Whatever the specifics, deep funk represents the sound of funk on its most elemental, grass-roots level; it's something akin to the way '60s garage bands enthusiastically copied their favorite British Invasion or psychedelic records -- some was truly inspired, some just competent, some instantly forgettable. The revival of interest in deep funk is closely tied to the hip-hop movement in America, with its ravenous appetite for fresh sample material, and to the rare groove and Northern soul club scenes in Britain, which place a premium on rediscovering vintage American musical artifacts (in funky jazz and sweet-leaning soul, respectively). In their worst leanings, deep funk collectors are concerned more with the object than the substance, prizing the thrill of the hunt and the single's rarity above its quality -- which is easy to do, since not many people have heard these tracks to begin with. The result is that some collectors and DJs wind up paying exorbitant prices for mediocre music. But at its best, deep funk is about giving credit to the unfairly overlooked -- discovering great grooves and tight combos that really did stack up musically. Although deep funk's true format is the vinyl single, labels like Goldmine, BBE, and Stones Throw, and compilers like Scottish DJ Keb Darge, have helped bring the pleasures of the funky 45 into the CD age.

Doo wop artists were vocal groups, with each singer in the group taking a different part that interweaved with the other singers. Frequently, the backing vocalists sang nonsense words as rhythm, and the genre's name derives from this trait. Most doo wop groups started as a cappella bands, performing without instrumental accompaniment. The hit doo wop singles inspired countless teenagers to form their own a cappella groups, though many of them were never recorded. Despite its a cappella origins, few doo wop records were made without instrumental backing. Doo wop faded away in the early '60s, though its influence was felt throughout popular music in the following decades.            "}
{"title": "Deep Funk Revival", "url": "https://www.allmusic.com/style/deep-funk-revival-ma0000012271", "discription": "                Deep funk revival, naturally enough, grew out of a renewal of interest in deep (read: obscure) funk on both sides of the Atlantic, mostly among DJs and record collectors. Whether they were looking for fresh sample material or just a great overlooked dance groove, deep funk attracted a cultish underground audience, and it was only a matter of time before some funk fanatics started making new recordings in the style toward the tail end of the '90s. Deep funk revival records were sometimes vocal performances (most notably by veteran James Brown disciple Lee Fields), but most often they were instrumentals by combos who were interested purely in the art of the groove. Because it's rooted in a style that requires its audience to be fairly obsessive, deep funk revival usually tries to re-create the feel of its inspirations as closely as possible -- the hard-driving grooves, the organic grit, even the lower-fidelity recording quality. The New York-based Desco label, the first devoted solely to deep funk revival, enhanced the illusion by creating playful hoaxes about the recording dates of their releases and the actual backgrounds of their groups; they also marketed and packaged their product to appeal to funk fetishists, issuing limited-edition 45 rpm records and CDs with low-budget artwork as retro as the music. Desco attracted some attention during the late '90s before splitting into two new labels, Dap-Tone and the ultra-raw Soul Fire. Most deep funk revival artists were concentrated in this label family, though not all. Most called James Brown or the Meters their primary influences, but not all; in keeping with funk collectors' related tastes, deep funk revival also included stylistic offshoots into jazz-funk and Afro-beat. Moreover, some better-known contemporary artists have dabbled in revivalist deep funk as part of a more eclectic vision, including the Beastie Boys, their keyboardist Money Mark, and acid-jazz staples the James Taylor Quartet.

Freestyle classics like \"I Wonder If I Take You Home\" by Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam, \"Let the Music Play\" by Shannon, and \"Party Your Body\" by Stevie B relied on angular, synthesized beats similar to electro and early house, but also emphasized the romantic themes of classic R&B and disco. The fusion of mechanical and sensual proved ready for crossover during the period, and both Shannon and Lisa Lisa hit the Top 40 during 1984-85. Freestyle also dovetailed nicely with the rise of dance pop during the mid-'80s -- Madonna's early producer and remixer, John Benitez (aka Jellybean), was also active in the freestyle community. By the end of the decade, a number of artists -- Expos\u00e9, Brenda K. Starr, Trinere, the Cover Girls, India, and Stevie B -- followed them into the pop or R&B charts. Even after popular success waned in the late '80s, though, freestyle moved to the underground as a vital stream of modern dance music alongside house, techno, and bass music. Similar to mainstream house, freestyle artists are usually (though by no means exclusively) either female vocalists or male producers. Newer figures like Lil Suzy, George Lamond, Angelique, Johnny O, and others became big stars in the freestyle community.            "}

Though it makes sense to classify any form of dance music made since disco as post-disco, each successive movement has had its own characteristics to make it significantly different from the initial post-disco era, whether it's dance-pop or techno or trance. There's no exact point where the original disco era ended and post-disco began, but as drum machines, synthesizers and programming became common studio tools, disco took on some radically different sounds while remaining similar in rhythmic structure and purpose. Post-disco was just as singles-driven as disco, with many of its most essential tracks coming from one-off projects and short-lived collaborations. Like disco and house, the most significant figures in post-disco were its architects -- producers, remixers, and DJs, many of which had been active in club music since the early '70s -- rather than the names on the fronts of the sleeves. Some variants of post-disco include boogie (midtempo tracks steeped in funk) and early Italo-disco (electronic tracks with heavy traces of Giorgio Moroder), as well as the beginnings of alternative dance (which often took cues from Italo-disco).

It was all high-energy pop and soul in the vein of Motown. Often, there were regional stars, such as General Johnson, and there were regional hits, but just as frequently national records were played locally.

Building on the steady groove of Hi Records and Stax/Volt singles, Philly soul added sweeping strings, seductive horns, and lush arrangements to the deep rhythms. As a result, it was much smoother -- even slicker -- than the deep soul of the late '60s, but the vocals remained as soulful as any previous form of R&B. Philly soul was primary a producer's medium, as Kenny Gamble & Leon Huff and Thom Bell created the instrumental textures that came to distinguish the genre. That isn't to short-change the vocalists, since the Spinners, the O'Jays, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, and the Stylistics were among many fine soul singers with distinctive voices, but the sonic elements that made Philly soul distinctive were the creation of the producers. Gamble & Huff worked with the Delfonics, Archie Bell, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, and the O'Jays; Bell produced the Spinners and the Stylistics, among others. The highly produced sound of Philly soul paved the way for the studio constructions of disco and urban contemporary R&B.            "}

Unlike the sound of boogaloo/Latin soul (based in New York City), early brown-eyed soul owed little to traditional Latin music and was rarely performed in Spanish. Instead, rock bands like Cannibal & the Headhunters (\"Land of 1000 Dances\") and Thee Midniters -- inspired by '50s Latino rocker Ritchie Valens -- earned national recognition playing anthemic rock & roll with an R&B edge. Smooth Chicago soul and Motown hits were big crowd favorites at dances during the early '60s (alongside a rare local sensation like Brenton Wood). When the East L.A. community began gradually moving from energetic R&B to romantic soul, the results were some of the sweetest soul music heard during the late '60s and '70s.Another wing of the brown-eyed soul crowd was influenced by Chicano, the Latino civil-rights movement emphasizing heritage and cultural pride. As a result, bands like War, Malo, El Chicano, and Tierra followed Latin-rock breakout Santana into the nation's cultural consciousness. Brown-eyed soul anthems kept edging the charts during the mid-'70s (a good example being Bloodstone's \"Natural High\"), but rarely breached the national radar after 1980. Rhino Records' three-volume series Brown Eyed Soul: The Sound of East L.A. remains the definitive document of all the imported hits and homegrown talent associated with the style.            "}

Unfortunately, Chicago's fertile soul community is often left off the map -- and if it's recognized at all, it's mostly for the accomplishments of Curtis Mayfield, both as a member of the Impressions and later as a solo act. The Chicago Soul scene obviously fostered a variety of production styles, but its best-known hits -- including \"The Monkey Time\" by Major Lance, \"Get on Up\" by the Esquires, \"People Get Ready\" by the Impressions, and \"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher\" by Jackie Wilson -- featured a sound based on laid-back yet effervescent soul, with sweet vocals and a stinging horn section. Though Mayfield is rightly the central figure in the rise of Chicago soul, considering his work as a songwriter and producer as well as bandleader and vocalist, arranger/producer Johnny Pate and producer/A&R man Carl Davis deserve much credit for development of the sound. Often in tandem with Mayfield, Pate's productions for ABC-Paramount and Davis' productions (first for OKeh and later for Brunswick and his own label, Dakar) created a parade of definitive hits for Chicago's best soul singers: the Impressions, Major Lance, Jackie Wilson, Gene Chandler, Jerry Butler, the Chi-Lites, Barbara Acklin, and Tyrone Davis, among others. Though the Chicago sound continued on into the '70s, the collapse of many independent labels proved a tragic blow to the fortunes of many fine soul singers.            "}

During the mid-'80s, go-go was quite popular within the rap and R&B underground, particularly around the DC area where it originated, but it never became a pop success; the closest it came to a crossover hit was in 1988, when EU -- along with Trouble Funk, the definitive go-go band -- had a moderate hit with \"Da Butt,\" taken from Spike Lee's School Daze. During the late '80s and early '90s, go-go was supplanted by Miami bass music, which took the groove-oriented aesthetic of go-go, turned up the bass, and de-emphasized the already-slim lyrics.

And, while it is certainly smooth, it's not as light as sweet soul. It's stylish and funky, classy but soulful. The quintessential Memphis soul artist is Al Green, and his '70s label, Hi, was the quintessential Memphis soul label. Hi's chief sonic architect, Willie Mitchell, developed the sound in the late '60s, but perfected it in the early '70s as he worked closely with Green.
